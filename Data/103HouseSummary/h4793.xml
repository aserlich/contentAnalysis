TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Self-Sufficency Program Title II: Other Provisions Title III: Related Amendments Title IV: Effective Date Self-Sufficiency Act of 1994 - Title I: Self-Sufficiency Program - Amends part A (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) (AFDC) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to grant States the option of establishing a self-sufficiency program in lieu of a job opportunities and basic skills (JOBS) training program. Requires any State that chooses such option to require increasing percentages of AFDC recipients to participate in the self-sufficiency program, reaching 100 percent participation by the end of ten years. Makes exceptions for recipients in specified circumstances. Sets forth reductions in AFDC payments to recipients who fail without good cause to participate in the self-sufficiency program. (Sec. 101) Sets forth general requirements for a State self-sufficiency plan. Requires a State to make an initial assessment of the educational, child care, and other supportive services needs as well as the skills, prior work experience, and employability of each program participant, including a review of the family circumstances and the needs of any child of the participant. Specifies the contents of a participant's self-sufficiency plan, including an employment goal. Requires the State to require the participant to negotiate and enter into an agreement on a specific self-sufficiency plan. Requires a State agency to inform AFDC applicants and recipients of education, employment, and training opportunities and support services (including child care and health coverage transition options). Requires establishment of procedures for resolution of disputes involving an individual's participation in the self-sufficiency program. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop performance standards for the program. (Sec. 102) Requires the guarantee of child care to participants in State self-sufficiency programs. Increases the Federal matching rate by ten percentage points for child care provided by States with self-sufficiency programs. (Sec. 103) Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to repeal the requirement that families in States with self-sufficiency programs must have received AFDC for a minimum period before becoming eligible for transitional Medicaid benefits or transitional child care benefits. (Sec. 105) Provides for transitional Medicaid benefits and transitional child care benefits in States with self-sufficiency programs without regard to type of income that would otherwise result in ineligibility for benefits. (Sec. 106) Eliminates certain exceptions from the requirement that minor parents and pregnant minors without children live with a responsible adult in States with self-sufficiency programs. Title II: Other Provisions - Provides for disregard, in the determination of AFDC payments, of persons who become family members after the initial receipt of AFDC in a State with a self-sufficiency program. (Sec. 202) Provides for enhanced AFDC payments for participants in a self-sufficiency program. (Sec. 203) Requires a State to make a lump-sum diversion payment, equal to three times the appropriate monthly AFDC payment, to any eligible family not yet receiving AFDC if the caretaker relative will be employed by the end of the three-month period that begins with the date the family will become an AFDC recipient. Requires reduction of any subsequent payments to such family to recover such diversion payment. Provides for three months of child care for a family receiving a diversion payment. (Sec. 205) Requires a State plan to make two-parent families ineligible for AFDC until 30 days after either parent's loss of employment. (Sec. 206) Increases the earned income disregard in States with a self-sufficiency program. Eliminates the time limitation on such disregard. Increases from $1,000 to $2,000 the asset limitations in such a State. (Sec. 208) Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to conform with this Act. Title III: Related Amendments - Denies welfare benefits to illegal aliens. Grants States the option to deny welfare benefits to aliens who are lawfully present in the United States. (Sec. 302) Requires provision to consumer reporting agencies of information on overdue child support obligations of absent parents. (Sec. 303) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for quarterly payments of the earned income credit. Title IV: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective date of this Act.
