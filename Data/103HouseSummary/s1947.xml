Health Care Anti-Fraud Act of 1994 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit and set penalties for knowingly: (1) executing a scheme or artifice to defraud to obtain a health care payment; or (2) presenting a statement containing false or misleading information as part of, or in support of, a claim for a health care payment. Increases such penalties if the offender knowingly or recklessly causes serious bodily injury or death or endangers the life of an individual. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) identify opportunities for the satisfaction of community service obligations that a court may impose upon the conviction of a health care fraud offense or under criminal penalties for acts involving Medicare or State health care programs; and (2) make information concerning such opportunities available to Federal and State law enforcement officers and State and local health care officials.
