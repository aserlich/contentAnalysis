	<summary>
	11/30/1994--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to prohibit the authority of each State to allocate quantities of water within its jurisdiction from being superseded, abrogated, or otherwise impaired. (Currently, it is the policy of the Congress that such authority not be superseded, abrogated, or impaired.) Provides that nothing in such Act authorizes: (1) the regulation of quantities of water or impairs or affects any State authority with respect to the allocation of water; (2) an action that affects any water right established by a State law, an interstate water compact, or a Supreme Court decree; and (3) an action with respect to other matters, including aesthetics not directly related to water quality. Declares that discharges into navigable waters will comply with narrative and numeric water quality criteria based on designated uses adopted in water quality standards. Prohibits State certifications with respect to discharges from regulating water use or quantities. Revises existing State authorities to incorporate the amendments made by this Act.
