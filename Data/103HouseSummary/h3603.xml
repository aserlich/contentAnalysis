(Sec. 202) Requires the Director to coordinate Federal activities and resources that are applied to life-cycle assessment in order to maximize the contribution of such assessments to sustainable economic development. (Sec. 203) Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to include goals for sustainable economic development within technology innovation programs. Includes such goals in other existing programs under specified Acts. Subtitle B: Environmental Technology - Establishes an Environmental Technologies Development and Integration Program, to be administered by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to promote the research, development, and integration of technologies that will contribute to sustainable economic development. Makes eligible for assistance projects that: (1) develop advanced, precommercial environmental technologies, with emphasis on technologies that will contribute to sustainable economic development; and (2) develop the integration of multiple steps in the conversion of materials that are involved in the manufacture, reuse, or recycling of a product, the recycling of process wastes, or the provision of a service. (Sec. 211) Prohibits intellectual property owned and developed by a business receiving financial assistance from being disclosed by the Federal Government except in accordance with an agreement. Provides that title to such property arising from assistance shall vest in a company incorporated in the United States or an institution of higher education in the United States.

(Sec. 213) Establishes the President's Total Environmental Quality Award to be awarded periodically to companies and other organizations which have benefited the United States through the development and deployment of environmental technologies. Establishes a National Environmentally Sound Technology Award for individuals who have pioneered the development and use of a highly innovative environmental technology. (Sec. 214) Directs the Administrator, acting through the EPA Office of Research and Development, to use existing information network capabilities to provide access to data on environmental technologies developed, tested, or verified by programs under this Act and by other appropriate sources. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into partnership agreements (&quot;alliances&quot;) with State or local government agencies and other specified entities to: (1) facilitate access to information incorporated in the networks; and (2) transfer to such entities other information that would enhance the development and adoption of environmental technologies. Encourages alliances to disseminate information, and provide technical assistance, to U.S. companies on opportunities for the more efficient use of materials and energy and for waste minimization, materials conversion, and recycling. Authorizes the Administrator to provide financial assistance to alliances under certain conditions. (Sec. 215) Directs the Administrator to establish a program to demonstrate the performance of environmental technologies at Federal laboratories and other Federal facilities. Makes U.S. companies and small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and institutions of higher education eligible to carry out demonstration projects. (Sec. 216) Directs the Administrator to establish a three-year pilot program to promote research on, and development of, environmentally efficient building materials through use of such materials in new and existing Federal facilities and buildings. Directs the Administrator to promulgate guidelines for Federal agencies on minimizing the creation of solid waste and maximizing the use of environmentally efficient building materials. Title III: Education - Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to support undergraduate and graduate activities in the development of coursework materials and curricula in all scientific, engineering, and technical disciplines to incorporate environmental soundness and total cost accounting into the corresponding curricula. (Sec. 302) Requires the Director of the EPA Office of Research and Development to develop and support programs to improve understanding of the relationships between technology and the environment. Title IV: Standards - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish: (1) a program to support the clarification of standards of performance for environmental technologies to clarify quality, performance, and substitutability for conventional products; and (2) a mechanism for recognizing non-Federal organizations engaged in environmental standards setting and associated product performance verification activities for purposes of ensuring quality and enhancing consumer confidence and international recognition. (Sec. 402) Authorizes the Administrator to enter into joint agreements with State and local governments and private sector representatives to support Environmental Technology Verification Centers that verify, evaluate, and disseminate information on the performance and cost of environmental technologies. Authorizes financial assistance to such Centers. Authorizes the Administrator to engage directly with private sector organizations through verification partnerships if the Centers cannot verify the performance of technologies because of scale or complexity. (Sec. 403) Directs the Federal Trade Commission to: (1) conduct a study of scientific and technological information needed for the fair evaluation of commercial performance claims regarding environmental technologies; and (2) develop a plan for collaboration with Federal agencies that have expertise in such technologies to ensure the use of the best available scientific and technological information in evaluating such claims. Title V: International Programs - Encourages the Administrator to support programs in other nations for purposes of enhancing U.S. exports of environmental technologies and promoting the contribution of such technologies to international sustainable economic development. (Sec. 503) Directs the Secretary of Commerce to support activities to promote the export of U.S. environmental technologies.
