	4/2/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude a deposit made by a policyholder under a qualified perpetual insurance policy from provisions governing the treatment of loans with below-market interest rates. Describes such a policy as one which: (1) provides insurance for property damage or casualty with respect to certain residential property (or the contents thereof); and (2) is funded only by the policyholder placing a cash deposit (and does not provide for any periodic premiums) which is fully refundable upon cancellation.
