	<summary>
	1/5/1993--Introduced.
Health Care Cost Containment Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow individuals to deduct the full amount of unreimbursed medical and dental expenses. (Current law allows a deduction for such expenses that exceed a certain percentage of adjusted gross income.) Requires the losing party in a medical care liability suit to pay limited amounts of the winning party's litigation expenses. Prohibits noneconomic damages (other than punitive damages) in such suits. Requires punitive damages to be paid to the unit of local government having primary responsibility for paying for indigent health services. Requires those amounts to be used for care for individuals entitled to assistance under titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act. Applies this Act to any medical care liability suit in any State or Federal court, except vaccine-related matters. Supersedes inconsistent State laws.
