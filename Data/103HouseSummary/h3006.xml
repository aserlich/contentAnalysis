United Nations Security Council Sanctions Enforcement Act - Requires the President, if he determines that the government of any foreign country is materially violating United Nations sanctions, to: (1) terminate U.S. foreign assistance to the country, except for food or humanitarian assistance; (2) terminate foreign military financing, sales of defense articles or services, and issuance of licenses for exports of items on the United States Munitions List with respect to the country; (3) oppose international financial institution lending for the country, except assistance to serve basic human needs; (4) deny the country U.S. Government or commercial credit or other financial assistance, with exceptions; (5) prohibit exports of specified goods and technology to the country, with exceptions; and (6) prohibit imports of such country into the United States. Authorizes the President to delay sanctions upon certification to the Congress that a country is taking actions to comply with United Nations sanctions. Provides for waivers of sanctions if a sanction would have an adverse effect on U.S. interests. Requires the President, if he determines that a person is materially violating United Nations sanctions, to prohibit: (1) procurement of goods and services from such person; (2) the issuance of an export license by or to a sanctioned person; and (3) the entry into U.S. customs territory of articles that are the growth, product, or manufacture of a sanctioned person. Exempts the procurement or importation of specified defense articles or services, spare or component parts, essential articles, or humanitarian items from sanctions. Authorizes the President to delay or waive sanctions against a foreign person under the same conditions that apply to foreign countries. Includes within the definition of a &quot;sanctioned person&quot; any successor entity to the person or any affiliate, parent, or subsidiary if they assisted in activities which were the basis of determination under this Act.
