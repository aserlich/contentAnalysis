	9/15/1993--Introduced.
Extends eligibility for hospital, nursing home, or outpatient medical care through the Department of Veterans Affairs to: (1) a veteran who may have been exposed to a herbicide agent while serving on active duty in Vietnam during the Vietnam era if the National Academy of Sciences has, in a report issued under the Agent Orange Act of 1991, made specified determinations regarding an association between exposure to a herbicide agent and occurrence of the veteran's disease; and (2) a radiation-exposed veteran if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, based on advice of the Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards, determines that there is credible evidence of a positive association between exposure to ionizing radiation and the veteran's disease. Terminates eligibility for herbicide-exposed veterans under this Act after September 30, 1996.
