Makes exceptions with respect to the military, law enforcement agencies, registered security guard services, and licensed handgun clubs and members of such clubs. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to approve such a transaction by licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers as necessary to meet the lawful requirements of such persons and entities covered by the exceptions. Specifies handgun club licensing requirements. Requires: (1) the Secretary to revoke the license of any such club that does not continue to meet such requirements; and (2) such club to pay to the Secretary an annual license fee of $25. Specifies security guard service registration requirements. Requires: (1) the Secretary to revoke such registration if the service does not continue to meet such requirements; and (2) such service to pay to the Secretary an annual registration fee of $50. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) recordkeeping (by licensed manufacturers, importers, dealers, handgun clubs or their members and by registered security guard services that transfer handguns or handgun ammunition); (2) reports of loss or theft; and (3) transfers to handgun clubs. Authorizes the voluntary delivery to any designated Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency of a handgun owned or possessed by a person. Directs the Secretary to: (1) arrange with each such agency to receive handguns for the transfer, destruction, or other disposition of such handguns; and (2) pay to such person $25 or the fair market value of the gun. Authorizes appropriations. Sets penalties for violations of this Act. Specifies that a person who voluntarily delivers a handgun under this Act after 180 days after enactment shall not be subject to criminal prosecution for possession of the handgun, but shall pay to the Secretary a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500.
