	10/3/1994--Introduced.
Commends the British and Irish Governments for their steps to encourage and facilitate all-party talks leading to a lasting political settlement acceptable to, and ratified by, the people of Ireland, north and south. Urges the two governments to include in such talks all parties that renounce violence. Hails the cessation of Irish Republican Army military operations as an essential step to such a settlement. Calls upon all other paramilitary organizations in Northern Ireland to cease the employment of violence. Expresses strong support for U.S. economic development programs such as the International Fund for Ireland and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Urges the President to take appropriate steps to support the peace process in Northern Ireland through such programs.
