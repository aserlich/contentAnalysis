	<summary>
	3/25/1994--Introduced.
Poverty Data Improvement Act of 1994 - Requires the Secretary of Commerce to biennially produce and publish data relating to the incidence of poverty for each State, county or borough, and local government, including Alaska native villages, (compiled from the most recent decennial census and for each school district). Authorizes such data to be produced by means of sampling, estimation, or any other method that the Secretary determines will produce current, comprehensive, and reliable data. Authorizes the Secretary to aggregate school districts if reliable data could not otherwise be produced for each school district, but only to the extent necessary to achieve reliability. Requires such data to be appropriately identified and accompanied by a detailed explanation as to how and why aggregation was used (including the measures taken to minimize any such aggregation). Requires the Secretary, if unable to produce and publish such data for any area, to report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on each government or school district excluded and the reasons therefor.
