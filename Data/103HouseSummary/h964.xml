	2/18/1993--Introduced.
Antarctic Environmental Protection Act of 1993 - Amends the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978 to revise provisions concerning prohibited acts to make it unlawful for any person (currently, U.S. citizen) to: (1) engage in any taking or harmful interference in Antarctica; (2) introduce into Antarctica any nonnative species; (3) enter any Antarctic specially protected area; or (4) discharge, dispose of, or introduce any waste or pollutant within Antarctica, except as permitted by the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. Makes it unlawful for any person to: (1) engage in or provide assistance to any Antarctic mineral resource activity; (2) ship, sell, import, export, or have control of any Antarctic mineral resource that was recovered as a result of such activity; (3) refuse to permit any U.S. official to board a vessel, vehicle, or aircraft for a search or inspection in connection with enforcement; or (4) interfere with a search, arrest, or detention for prohibited acts. Exempts from such prohibition any act committed under emergency circumstances. Revises requirements for the issuance of permits authorizing takings or harmful interferences or introductions of nonnative species in Antarctica. Requires certain regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State to apply to any person's (currently, U.S. citizen's) advance notification of expeditions to, and within, Antarctica. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations to require nongovernmental activities in Antarctica for which the United States is required to give advance notice under the Antarctic Treaty to provide for prompt response actions to emergencies and to comply with contingency plans. Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to prescribe regulations to implement the environmental impact assessment provisions of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty with respect to governmental activities in Antarctica. Directs the Secretary to prescribe such regulations for nongovernmental activities in Antarctica. Directs the Secretary to designate the U.S. representative to the Committee for Environmental Protection. Expands penalty and enforcement provisions. Repeals the Antarctic Protection Act of 1990. Directs the President to establish an Antarctic Environmental Protection Commission to review the compliance of all U.S. Antarctic Program stations, field camps, and operations with the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978.
