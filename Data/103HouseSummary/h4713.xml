	6/30/1994--Introduced.
Regional Fishery Management Councils Ethics Act of 1994 - Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to provide that sustainable use should be regarded as the touchstone of the program for fishery conservation and management. Sets forth recusal requirements for Fishery Management Council members who disclose financial conflicts of interest in matters before a Council. Establishes an oath for Council members with respect to financial disclosures. Sets forth conduct criteria for the staff of Councils. Prohibits reprisals against a staff member for whistleblower disclosures of management actions. Revises Council meeting procedures. Requires fishery management plans to be based on a clear preponderance of evidence. Establishes time limits for the approval and implementation of regulatory amendments to fishery management plans. Subjects Council actions to judicial review. Revises current national standards for fishery conservation and management. Adds a new standard that conservation and management measures shall promote the safety of life and property at sea. Requires a two-thirds vote of a Council on economic allocations. Requires Councils to establish systems to limit access to a fishery if it is overcapitalized and such over-capitalization is contributing to overfishing. Gives the guidelines of the Secretary of Commerce (based on the national standards) the force and effect of law. Dedicates two new seats on a Council to nonfishing industry representatives.
