	<summary>
	9/30/1994--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to establish a centralized personnel locator service that includes the addresses of each member of the armed forces. Requires addresses of members of the Coast Guard to be included upon request of the Secretary of Transportation. Requires the Secretary to update the locator service within 30 days after a listed member establishes a new address. Directs the Secretary to make such information available, upon request, to the Federal Parent Locator Service. Directs the Secretary of each military department (and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy) to prescribe regulations to facilitate the granting of leave for purposes of attending court hearings to determine either parentage or an obligation to provide child support. States that it is not necessary that the date of a certification of the authenticity or completeness of a copy of a court order for child support received by the Secretary concerned (such support to be paid through the retired pay of the member involved) be recent. Allows the Secretary concerned to make required child support payments to a State when a spouse or former spouse assigns to a State the right to receive support. Empowers the Secretary concerned to pay child support arrearages through the disposable retired pay of the responsible member.
