	5/26/1993--Introduced.
United States Information Agency Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 - Authorizes appropriations for the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) for FY 1994 and 1995. Amends the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 to authorize the USIA Director to: (1) carry out projects involving security construction and related improvements for USIA facilities not collocated with Department of State facilities abroad; and (2) contract with individuals for personal services abroad (currently, employ aliens by contract for such services). Repeals a specified provision of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 which sets limitations on reductions of USIA employees abroad. Provides that nothing shall preclude USIA from keeping the U.S. public informed of its operations, policies, or programs. Authorizes USIA to enter into contracts of up to seven years for circuit capacity to distribute radio and television programs. Permits USIA to receive funds from international organizations of which the United States is a member. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize the issuance of up to 100 conditional immigrant visas per fiscal year to USIA employees. Makes 150 visas available to current employees upon enactment of this Act. Sets forth conditions for the removal of conditional status and for termination of such status. Confers special immigrant status on such individuals.
