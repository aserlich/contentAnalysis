(Sec. 101) Authorizes States to: (1) reduce amounts required for matching contributions to capitalization grants for water pollution control revolving funds by an amount equal to the amount of technical assistance provided to publicly owned treatment works or subsurface sewage disposal systems that serve 10,000 or fewer individuals; and (2) forgive an amount of loan principal for disadvantaged communities with respect to loans for water pollution control activities. Revises the allotment formula for revolving funds and extends the authorization of appropriations for such funds through FY 2000. Increases amounts authorized to be appropriated for FY 1996 through 2000 subject to certain on-budget deficit estimates. Reserves funds for a grant to implement a plan for the elimination of discharges to Onondaga Lake, New York. (Sec. 102) Extends the authorization of appropriations for specified pollution control programs through FY 2000. Title II: Toxic Pollution Prevention and Control - Adds to the list of requirements for effluent limitation guidelines that the Administrator: (1) in determining the best practicable control technology and best measures available, give highest priority to source reduction measures; (2) identify control measures to limit the release of pollutants associated with wastewater to other environmental media; and (3) prohibit specific control measures that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on any environmental medium. (Sec. 201) Revises provisions concerning pretreatment standards to require the Administrator to promulgate pretreatment standards for the introduction of pollutants (currently, pollutants which are not susceptible to treatment or would interfere with the operation of the treatment works) into publicly owned treatment works. (Sec. 202) Directs the Administrator to publish a water quality criteria plan every five years. Requires the initial plan to contain at least eight sediment quality criteria. Directs the Administrator to: (1) require pesticide registrants to provide information sufficient to publish criteria unless the pesticide will not enter water in more than de minimis amounts; and (2) ensure that information necessary to publish criteria for chemical substances that are the subject of a premanufacture notice pursuant to the Toxic Substances Control Act is submitted unless certain conditions are met. Requires the Administrator to publish guidance concerning contaminant levels in finfish and shellfish for use by States in the issuance of finfish and shellfish consumption advisories to protect recreational and subsistence fishers. Prohibits sediment quality criteria published under this Act from being: (1) used as a standard for determining appropriate cleanup levels or for whether cleanup should be undertaken; or (2) deemed an applicable requirement for remediation unless the Administrator determines criteria appropriate for such use. Requires States to report triennially to the Administrator on the designated uses of waters. Deems all waters for which a use has not been designated to be designated as fishable and swimmable, unless a State establishes an alternative use. Directs States to adopt pollutant specific standards for any pollutant for which criteria are published if the discharge of such pollutant could interfere with designated water uses. Requires States to implement antidegradation policies. Directs States to implement programs to protect outstanding national resource waters. Requires permitting authorities to conduct antidegradation reviews for a water prior to issuing a permit to a point source authorizing any new or expanded discharge of a pollutant.

(Sec. 204) Authorizes the Administrator to impose pretreatment requirements on industrial users that introduce pollutants into publicly owned treatment works. Prohibits the introduction of hazardous wastes into publicly owned treatment works unless certain conditions are met. Directs the Administrator to publish guidance for: (1) toxic reduction action plans (one of the conditions to be met if introducing hazardous wastes) to be implemented by certain commercial users that are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and that introduce toxic pollutants or hazardous wastes into treatment works; and (2) technical assistance to small communities to assist in minimizing the introduction of toxic pollutants and hazardous wastes from commercial sources into treatment works. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations revising the definition and applicability of certain local limits under Federal regulations as may be necessary to protect health and the environment with respect to hazardous wastes discharged to publicly owned treatment works. Requires revised limits to address all points from which hazardous wastes may be released from a treatment works to the environment. Directs the Administrator to study and report to the Congress on actual discharges of hazardous wastes to treatment works to determine quantities, the sources of the discharges, the releases from various release points, and resulting threats to health and the environment. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes a publicly owned treatment works to apply to the Administrator for the designation of the treatment works as a publicly owned industrial treatment works. Provides for approval of the application if: (1) greater than 75 percent of the wastewater received is from one or more industrial sources; (2) the works was specifically designed to treat pollutants associated with such sources; (3) the works consistently complies with applicable effluent limitations that are as stringent as those that would apply if the works were an industrial facility; (4) sludge from the works meets requirements for beneficial reuse; and (5) the works has imposed controls on all pollutants received from such sources as necessary to protect health and the environment. (Sec. 205) Amends the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 to require facilities that are subject to toxic chemical release reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 and whose reports total releases and transfers of toxic chemicals in excess of 200,000 pounds annually to prepare pollution prevention plans. Deems small businesses to be in compliance with such requirement if they retain a pollution prevention opportunities assessment manual and checklist. Requires facilities to include pollution prevention progress reports with each annual filing of toxic chemical release reports. Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish an integrated pollution prevention information network; (2) develop industry-specific pollution prevention opportunities assessment manuals and checklists for industrial categories with respect to which the lack of information is an impediment to pollution prevention by small businesses; and (3) establish a program to promote local voluntary programs to prevent pollution and promote energy conservation. (Sec. 206) Requires the Administrator to establish an integrated| permit pilot program at up to ten demonstration sites that: (1) combines all applicable Federal environmental requirements (with exceptions) into a single integrated permit; and (2) provides the sites the opportunity to demonstrate innovative and alternative methods of compliance with such requirements.
