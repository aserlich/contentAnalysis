	<summary>
	3/17/1994--Introduced.
Health Care Fraud and Abuse Act of 1994 - Amends title XI of the Social Security Act to: (1) increase civil monetary penalties; (2) expand criminal penalties to include treble damages; (3) provide for the application of such sanctions to fraud and abuse involving any health benefit plan; and (4) include civil monetary penalties in anti-kickback sanctions. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to publish regulations establishing a program of voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing providing for less substantial sanctions than those otherwise imposed for health care fraud and abuse. Authorizes appropriations for hiring additional personnel for HHS's Office of Inspector General to sustain and expand the investigation of health care fraud.
