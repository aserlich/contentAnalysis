	7/15/1993--Introduced.
Security Officers Employment Standards Act of 1993 - Requires each State: (1) to allocate not less than five percent of funds received under title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to the implementation of the requirements of this Act; and (2) to have in effect screening, training, and other requirements and procedures for issuing licenses to, and reviewing security services of, security contractors. Sets limits on license fees. Bars an employer from assigning an employee to duty as a private security officer (officer) until such employee obtains a security officer's registration permit, with exceptions. Requires each State to have in effect a permit program that prohibits employers from assigning an employee to such duty until the employer submits to the State regulatory agency specified certifications, including certifications with respect to: (1) employment history and personal references; (2) passage of a drug screening test that meets National Institute on Drug Abuse guidelines; (3) a check of records obtained at the request of the employer through the National Crime Information Center and fingerprint records on file with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (makes provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 inapplicable to the disclosure of such records); and (4) a psychological evaluation approved by the State regulatory agency and conducted by a qualified individual. Amends the Federal judicial code to authorize the Attorney General to exchange records and information with private employers whose primary business consists of contracting to provide the services of a security officer. Directs the Attorney General to issue rules establishing procedures for the disclosure of records requested by employers and requiring such employers to pay a specified fee to the disclosing agency. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) training requirements for officers; and (2) State issuance of registration permits. Requires States to have in effect: (1) specified requirements regarding notice of, and permit suspension and revocation based on, criminal charges against an officer; and (2) a law authorizing the imposition of a penalty for violation of requirements imposed by the State to satisfy a condition of eligibility of a security contractor.
