	<summary>
	1/26/1993--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to implement the Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Program consistent with the provisions of this Act. Establishes the environmental sciences review panel for certain areas of the Outer Continental Shelf off-shore Florida in order to assess the adequacy of oceanographic, ecological, and socio-economic information available with respect to authorizing leasing and exploration, development, and production activities. Sets limitations with respect to preleasing activities and lease sales within such areas, including specific points in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to: (1) include within certain required environmental studies an assessment of the adequacy of available physical oceanographic, ecological, and socioeconomic information; and (2) provide that certain lessee compensation may be a combination of currency and forgiveness of debts due on other leases.
