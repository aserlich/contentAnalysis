	8/9/1994--Passed House amended. United States China Policy Act of 1994 - Declares that the Congress affirms the President's policy toward China and makes the following recommendations for the conduct of U.S. policy toward that country, including: (1) a continued U.S. policy of pressing for increased Chinese adherence to internationally recognized human rights; (2) U.S. concern for the accounting and release of political prisoners, access to Chinese prisoners by international humanitarian organizations, and negotiations between China and the Dalai Lama on Tibetan issues; (3) expanded U.S. broadcasting to China through the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia; and (4) further U.S. steps to foster in China the rule of law, the creation of a civic society, and the emergence of institutions that provide humane and effective governance. Urges the President, when considering termination of the suspensions of U.S. Government activities enacted in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, to explore whether such terminations could be used to elicit specific steps by the Chinese to enhance respect for internationally recognized human rights or to correct abuses of such rights. (Sec. 4) Declares it to be U.S. policy, in fostering human rights in China, to promote the following objectives: (1) an effective legal system, based on the rule of law; (2) respect for internationally recognized human rights; (3) the emergence of civil society; and (4) the creation of institutions that provide humane and effective goverance. Authorizes appropriations for programs to carry out the objectives of this Act. (Sec. 5) Expresses the sense of the Congress that, in the event that international humanitarian organizations undertake activities in China related to the treatment of prisoners, the President should make available additional contributions to such organizations to support them. (Sec. 6) Declares that the Congress endorses President Clinton's efforts to work with U.S. leaders of the business community to develop principles that could be adapted by U.S. companies doing business in China to advance human rights. Commends U.S. companies that have adopted such principles. Urges the President to encourage other governments to adopt such principles in governing the activities of their businesses in China. (Sec. 7) Requires the President to review and report to specified congressional committees on U.S. activities to promote human rights in China. (Sec. 8) Authorizes the President to establish a U.S. commission on law and society in China to monitor developments in China with respect to the specified objectives of U.S. policy.
