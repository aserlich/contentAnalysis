Hospital to Home- and Community-Care Linkage Development and Incentive Grant Program - Amends the Public health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to disseminate information and materials to assist specified entities in replicating successful programs aimed at offering care management to hospitalized individuals in need of long-term care so that services to meet individual needs and preferences can be arranged in home- and community-based settings as an alternative to long-term nursing home placement. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to such entities. Directs the Secretary to establish a program under which incentive grants may be awarded to assist agencies and organizations in developing and expanding programs and projects that facilitate the discharge of individuals in hospitals or other acute care facilities who are in need of long-term care services and placement of such individuals into home- and community-based settings. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) eligibility to receive grants; (2) application requirements; (3) criteria for the award of grants; (4) use of, and limitations on, grants; and (5) evaluation and reports. Authorizes appropriations.
