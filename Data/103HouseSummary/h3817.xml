	<summary>
	7/12/1994--Passed House amended. Amends the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 to: (1) authorize reimbursement for a fee for a vessel of the United States to transit foreign waters on a voyage between U.S. points when the U.S. regards the fee as inconsistent with international law; (2) delete a provision requiring that fees charged to U.S. commercial fishermen to cover reimbursement costs for seized U.S. commercial fishing vessels in foreign ports should be based on at least one-third of the Federal contribution for such costs; (3) allow such fees to be collected whether or not they are needed to provide reimbursements for actual costs, confiscation or spoilage of fish, and loss of income under the Act; and (4) extend such reimbursement provisions through October 1, 1996. Mandates publication of a list of nations that impose transit fees and withholding of clearance for commercial fishing vessels of those nations for entry into U.S. waters west of a specified longitude, subject to exception. Declares the owner or master of a vessel entering in violation of these provisions to be in violation of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Makes the designation of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary effective on a specified date, notwithstanding specified provisions of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act.
