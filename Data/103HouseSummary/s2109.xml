	5/12/1994--Introduced.
Access to Community Health Care Act of 1994 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow community health centers to provide: (1) services at schools and other appropriate locations; and (2) specified enabling and outreach services. (Sec. 2) Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants (including planning and development grants) to one or more community health centers receiving medically underserved population grants, or to one or more federally qualified health centers, to support development of a community health service network or plan. Requires such a network or plan to be governed by individuals a majority of whom are registered network or plan patients, or representatives of entities providing health services under grants, or a combination of such individuals. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants for planning, developing, and operating health networks and plans that will provide or enhance the provision and accessibility of specified services to medically underserved populations and health professional shortage areas in the network or plan's service area. Requires a network or plan, as a condition of grant approval, to assure significant community involvement, including: (1) a board of governors one-third of whom are registered patients or representatives of entities providing health services under grants, or a combination of both; or (2) a patient advisory board. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 3) Authorizes the Secretary to make and guarantee loans to grant-receiving entities for: (1) acquisition, modernization, expansion, conversion, or construction of facilities with respect to medically underserved populations; (2) major equipment purchases; (3) establishment of reserves required for furnishing services on a prepaid basis; and (4) other necessary capital costs. Sets forth preferences and priorities in the making of such loans and loan guarantees. Establishes a Loan and Loan Guarantee Fund (Fund) in the Treasury. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to preserve tax-exempt status for any State or local bonds guaranteed by the Fund. (Sec. 4) Allows migrant health centers to provide: (1) services at schools and other appropriate locations; and (2) specified enabling and outreach services. Authorizes a homeless health services grant to include the acquisition, modernization, or expansion of existing buildings, or construction of new buildings. Authorizes appropriations for migrant and homeless health centers. (Sec. 5) Authorizes additional appropriations for the National Health Service Corps. (Sec. 6) Sets forth preferences for certain health professions program and nurse training program applicants. Revises specified requirements with respect to payment for direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education. (Sec. 7) Amends title XI (General Provisions and Peer Review) of the Social Security Act (SSA) with respect to specified safeguards (including freedom of choice of care and services provider) for rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers in Medicaid demonstrations. (Sec. 8) Amends SSA title XI to exempt from specified criminal penalties for acts involving Medicare and State health programs any remuneration paid by or to a Federal grant recipient or subrecipient in connection with an arrangement for goods or services procurement, if certain requirements are met. Requires, among other things, that such an arrangement will: (1) result in the savings of Federal grant funds or increased revenues to the recipient or subrecipient that will be used to increase the availability of or improve services to a medically underserved population; and (2) not result in private inurement to any current employees or members of the Board of Directors of the recipient or subrecipient, or to agents involved in recommending or negotiating the arrangement. Exempts from such criminal penalties any arrangement failing to meet such requirements which is approved by the Secretary because it will produce substantial benefit to a medically underserved population that outweighs any failure to meet those requirements.
