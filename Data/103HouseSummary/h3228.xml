	10/6/1993--Introduced.
Emergency Immigrant Education Act of 1993 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish an emergency immigrant education program. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Education to allocate program payments to State educational agencies for services for immigrant children in elementary and secondary schools in local educational agency districts where the number of immigrant children is equal to at least 1,000 or at least five percent of the total number of students enrolled in public and nonpublic schools during that fiscal year. Allows a State to reserve not more than three percent of such funds for such services in local educational agencies which do not meet such criteria. Authorizes the Secretary, also under such program, to make district-wide immigrant grants for other services for immigrant children to local educational agencies whose districts include numbers of such children in public and nonpublic schools equal to at least 5,000 or at least ten percent.
