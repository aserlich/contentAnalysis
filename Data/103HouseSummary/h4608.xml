	10/3/1994--Reported to House amended. Patent and Trademark Office Authorization Act of 1994 - Authorizes appropriations to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for FY 1995. Prohibits a reduction in the number of full-time equivalent employees in the Office during the five-year period beginning on October 1, 1994, unless: (1) a law is enacted that specifically requires reductions in personnel or positions in such Office; or (2) the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks determines that such reduction is in the best interests of the Office and the public. Exempts the Office, during such five-year period, from any law imposing a restriction on hiring by the executive agencies or reductions in force by executive agencies to achieve reductions in the Federal work force. Changes the status of the Commissioner from an Assistant Secretary of Commerce to an Under Secretary of Commerce (thereby allowing the Commissioner to be compensated at the same rate as Under Secretaries of Commerce).
