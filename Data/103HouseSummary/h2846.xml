	8/3/1993--Introduced.
Congressional Employees Fairness Act - Makes applicable to the Congress: (1) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; (2) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (3) specified provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; and (4) the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Makes applicable to the Congress any provision of Federal law to the extent that it relates to: (1) the terms and conditions of employment (including hiring, promotion, or demotion, salary and wages, overtime compensation, benefits, work assignments or reassignments, and termination) of employees; (2) protection from discrimination in personnel actions; (3) the health and safety of employees; (4) the availability of information to the public; or (5) other areas deemed appropriate by the Independent Office of Compliance (Office). Establishes the Office, in the legislative branch, to study and report to the Congress on the application of such laws. Sets forth provisions relating to congressional procedures for approval of the Board of Directors' recommendations relating to the application of future Federal laws to the Congress. Directs the Office to carry out an education program for Members of Congress and other employing authorities of the Congress respecting the laws applicable to them and a program to inform individuals of their rights under laws applicable to the Congress and under this Act. Requires the procedure for consideration of alleged violations of such laws to consist of the following steps: (1) counseling; (2) mediation; (3) formal complaint and hearing by a hearing board; and (4) judicial review of a hearing board's decision. Authorizes a congressional employee or any Member of Congress to petition the Personnel Appeals Board of the General Accounting Office to review a final decision if it is unconstitutional. Declares that any intimidation of, or reprisal against, any employee because of the exercise of a right under this Act constitutes an unlawful employment practice that may be remedied in the same manner under this Act as is a violation of a law made applicable to the Congress. Requires the records and decisions of hearing boards to be made public if required for judicial review. Limits a congressional employee to the judicial proceeding provided by this Act to redress prohibited practices.
