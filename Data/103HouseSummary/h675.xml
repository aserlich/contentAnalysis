	1/27/1993--Introduced.
Amends Federal law to continue appropriations automatically if a regular appropriations bill covering a project or activity does not become law by the beginning of a fiscal year. Continues appropriations at the funding level of the preceding fiscal year or, if the relevant Act did not become law, in accordance with criteria prescribed in this Act. Declares it to be out of order in the House of Representatives or in the Senate to consider or to vote on the question of agreeing to any continuing appropriations legislation. Permits a waiver of this restriction in the Senate by a three-fifths vote.
