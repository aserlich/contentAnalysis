	10/7/1993--Introduced.
Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit and set penalties for knowingly circumcising, excising, or infibulating any part of the labia majora, labia minora, or clitoris of another person who has not attained age 18, except where: (1) necessary to the health of the person on whom it is performed (if performed by a person licensed in the place of its performance as a medical practitioner); or (2) performed on a person in labor or who has just given birth (if performed for medical purposes connected with such labor or birth by a person licensed in the place it is performed as a medical practitioner, midwife, or person in training to become such a practitioner or midwife). Prohibits and sets penalties for knowingly denying a person medical care or services, or otherwise discriminating against a person in the provision of medical care or services, because that person has: (1) undergone female circumcision, excision, or infibulation (female circumcision); or (2) requested that female circumcision be performed on any person. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to carry out appropriate education, preventive, and outreach activities in communities that traditionally practice female circumcision to inform people in those communities about the health risks and emotional trauma inflicted by such practices and to inform them and the medical community about the provisions of this Act.
