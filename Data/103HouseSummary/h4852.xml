Makes any U.S. vessel eligible to receive such a license unless the vessel was previously authorized to be used for fishing on the high seas by a foreign nation and such nation suspended or, within the last three years preceding application for a license, withdrew such authorization because the vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures.

Sets forth application and fee provisions.

(Sec. 408) Declares the sense of the Congress regarding measures to be taken to promote the conservation and management of Atlantic bluefin tuna throughout the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Title V: Fishermen's Protective Act - Amends the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967 to direct the Secretary of State to reimburse vessel owners for fees paid to a foreign government to navigate in its waters if such a fee is regarded by the United States as being inconsistent with international law.
