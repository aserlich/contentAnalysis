	11/9/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Federal criminal code to provide for the death penalty for murders involving firearms. Specifies that, in order to prosecute such a crime at the Federal level: (1) the conduct of the offender must have occurred in the course of an offense against the United States; or (2) a firearm involved in the offense must have moved in interstate or foreign commerce. Expresses the intent of the Congress that: (1) this Act shall be used to supplement but not supplant the efforts of State and local prosecutors in prosecuting murders involving firearms that have moved in interstate or foreign commerce that could be prosecuted under State law; and (2) the Attorney General shall give due deference to the interest of a State or local prosecutor in prosecuting the defendant under State law.
