	4/2/1993--Introduced.
Requires the Internal Revenue Service to provide the same relief in 1990 that was provided in 1987, 1988, and 1989 to employees who received distributions under a governmental plan in connection with the transition to a new retirement system, where some of them erroneously treated such distributions as eligible for rollover treatment.
