	5/13/1993--Introduced.
Small Business Assistance and Credit Crunch Relief Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require each appropriate Federal banking agency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to take into consideration, in resolving the problems of an insured depository institution, the potential disruption to the local economy if the institution is closed or otherwise subjected to sanctions by Federal regulators. Prohibits such an agency from promulgating any new regulation until it has conducted a regulatory impact analysis and concluded that the regulation's benefits outweigh its costs, including the benefits and costs for small banks (those with total assets of less than $400 million). Directs each agency to conduct a thorough review and evaluation of all: (1) statutory provisions affecting small banks; and (2) regulatory provisions affecting such banks that have been promulgated by such agency. Provides for the suspension of regulations determined to be no longer necessary or ineffective and for the submission to the Congress of a recommendation to suspend the applicability of any Federal law that affects small banks. Requires publication of such suspensions in the Federal Register and appropriate consultation for such determinations. Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 to raise from $100,000 to $250,000 the threshold for licensed or certified real estate appraisals on small business loans. Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to require the minimization of regulatory paperwork burden and costs of compliance under such Act for small banks with the highest (outstanding) compliance rating as determined under such Act. Exempts small banks rated &quot;outstanding&quot; from any documentation requirements. Outlines penalties and documentation requirements for small banks receiving a &quot;substantial noncompliance&quot; rating. Requires each appropriate Federal banking agency to: (1) review the extent to which this Act has reduced and eliminated unnecessary internal written policies; and (2) issue a recommendation as to whether this Act should be extended beyond the sunset date of three years after its enactment.
