	<summary>
	11/21/1993--Introduced.
Expresses continued support for the United Nations Secretary General's current efforts regarding Cyprus. Calls on the Republic of Turkey to support the Secretary General's package of confidence-building measures and to take necessary steps to help resolve the Cyprus problem. Encourages the Turkish Cypriot community to accept the package. Agrees that the Secretary General should invite the Security Council to consider alternative ways to promote the effective implementation of its many resolutions on Cyprus if current efforts do not succeed soon. Declares that the Congress: (1) is aware that the Security Council's adoption of sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter may be the only alternative available to compel compliance with the dictates of the international community regarding Cyprus; and (2) will encourage the executive branch to support those sanctions if necessary to resolve the conflict.
