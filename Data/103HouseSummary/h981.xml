	2/18/1993--Introduced.
Entitles to a survivor annuity a former spouse who was divorced on or before December 4, 1991, from a participant in the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System (CIARDS) and who was married to that participant for not less than ten years during such participant's creditable service, at least five years of which were spent by the participant as an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) outside of the United States or otherwise in a position designated by the Director of the CIA as a hazardous position or one clearly distinguished from normal government service. Prescribes the annuity amount and requires it to be reduced by any survivor annuity paid to such former spouse under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System (CSRS). Entitles the same former spouses of CIARDS participants to a retirement annuity of: (1) 50 percent of the participant's retirement annuity, if the former spouse was married to the participant throughout the period of the participant's creditable service; or (2) the pro rata share of the participant's retirement annuity equal to the number of years of marriage compared to the number of years of the participant's creditable service. Reduces the retirement annuity by any amounts payable to a former spouse pursuant to a court order incident to a dissolution of marriage or property settlement. Prohibits the payment of any survivor or retirement annuity if the former spouse: (1) remarries before age 55; (2) is less than 50 years of age; or (3) meets the definition of &quot;former spouse&quot; in effect under CIARDS before December 4, 1991. Requires an election of benefits if a former spouse is eligible for retirement annuity benefits under CIARDS and for any other retirement benefits under CIARDS or another government retirement system based on marriage to someone other than the CIARDS participant. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to entitle to coverage under a health benefits plan for CIA employees and their spouses and dependents former spouses who meet the same requirements as described under provisions above for the survivor annuity and who were enrolled in a health benefits plan at any time during the 18-month period before the date of dissolution of the marriage to the CIARDS participant. Requires the former spouse to enroll in such health benefits plan within 60 days after notification by the CIA Director of eligibility for such plan. Provides for the payment of the survivor and retirement annuities described in this Act from the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund.
