	8/5/1993--Introduced.
Nutritional Advertising Coordination Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to direct such Commission to prescribe rules prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts and practices in food advertising. Requires such rules to require that claims in advertising for food characterizing the level of any nutrient in food or the relationship of any such nutrient to a disease be consistent with specified provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act concerning misbranded food. Authorizes a State to bring a civil action when it believes that such rules have been violated.
