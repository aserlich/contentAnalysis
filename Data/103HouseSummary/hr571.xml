	10/6/1994--Introduced.
Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to add rule LII to establish an Office of Compliance to apply the following laws to the House of Representatives: (1) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; (2) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (3) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; (4) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; (5) Titles I and V of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993; (6) the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970; (7) specified provisions of Federal law relating to Federal labor-management relations; (8) the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (except with respect to the Capitol Police); (9) the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act; and (10) the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Applies any provision of Federal law that relates to the terms and conditions of employment of employees to the House. Prohibits lobbyists, Members of Congress, and congressional employees from being on the Office Board of Directors. Requires the Board of Directors to study and report to the House on how the laws under rule LII should apply. Directs the Office to: (1) carry out a program of education for House Members and other House employing authorities respecting such laws and a program to inform individuals of their rights; (2) compile specified statistics, including those on the use of the Office by House employees, reasons for contact, and complaints filed; and (3) develop a system for the collection of demographic data respecting the composition of House employees and for collection of information on employment practices. Sets forth procedures for consideration of alleged violations of such laws consisting of the following steps: (1) counseling; (2) mediation; and (3) formal complaint and hearing by a hearing board. Declares that any intimidation of, or reprisal against, any House employee because of the exercise of a right under this Act constitutes an unlawful employment practice that may be remedied in the same manner under this Act as a violation of a law made applicable under rule LII. Directs the Office to study and report to the House on the application to the House of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974. Amends rule XLV of the Rules of the House to permit travel awards that accrue by reason of official travel of a House Member, officer, or employee to be used only with respect to official travel.
