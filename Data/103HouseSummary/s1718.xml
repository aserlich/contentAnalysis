Allows the Court, at its discretion, to certify a case or class of cases for review before it has been determined by the D.C. Court of Appeals, but only under limited circumstances described in this Act. Allows the Court to: (1) answer questions of law certified to it by the U.S. Supreme Court, a Court of Appeals of the United States, or the highest court of any State, if a question of D.C. law may be determinative of the case pending in the certifying court; and (2) order the certification of a question of law of another State to the highest court of such State. Provides for the temporary assignment of Court judges to and from other D.C. courts. Directs the chief justice of the Court to annually summon the active judges of the D.C. courts to a Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia for the purpose of advising as to the means of improving the administration of justice within the District of Columbia. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Judges of the District of Columbia Courts - Makes the District of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission, rather than the President, responsible for designating the chief justice or chief judge of a D.C. court. Directs the Executive Officer of the District of Columbia courts to study and report to the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration in the District of Columbia, for forwarding with any comments and recommendations to the Congress, on the feasibility of establishing a District of Columbia Night Court as a division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.
