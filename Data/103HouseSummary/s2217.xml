Prohibits, in the case of dependents accompanying military personnel assigned to permanent duty ashore in Europe: (1) the payment of travel and transportation expenses; and (2) the expenditure of funds for support. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to waive such prohibition if determined necessary to ensure the effective conduct of necessary activities of military personnel in Europe, or if determined necessary for national security purposes. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the duty period for such military personnel should not exceed one year.
