	8/11/1994--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that victims of domestic violence face growing harassment from their predators and deserve the highest level of protection from that harassment. Urges each State to allow a victim of domestic violence to change names in a manner that keeps the change private and not printed in any public record (with disclosure of the change made only to bona fide and verified creditors of the victim and to police acting in official capacity and when accompanied by immediate notice to the victim), at a minimum cost, and in a short period of time.
