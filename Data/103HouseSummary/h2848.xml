	8/3/1993--Introduced.
Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act of 1993 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize a State Governor to prohibit the disposal of out-of-State municipal waste in any landfill or incinerator in the State. Exempts from a Governor's authority to prohibit the disposal of out-of-State waste: (1) landfills that received documented shipments of such waste in 1991 and are in compliance with Federal and State laws relating to design and location standards, leachate collection, groundwater monitoring, and financial assurance for closure and post-closure and corrective action; (2) proposed landfills that, prior to January 1, 1993, received an approval from the affected local government or solid waste planning unit to receive municipal waste generated outside the jurisdiction of the local government, planning unit, or State and a State notice of decision to grant a construction permit; or (3) incinerators that received documented shipments of such waste during 1991 and are in compliance with performance standards under the Clean Air Act and Federal and State laws relating to facility design, operations, and emissions. Authorizes State Governors, beginning in 1993, to further limit the quantity of out-of-State waste received for disposal, or the disposal of such waste, at specified landfills and incinerators. Applies the authorities of this Act to industrial waste to be disposed of at landfills or incinerators that receive municipal solid waste. Prohibits discrimination against shipments of out-of-State waste on the basis of State of origin. Authorizes a State Governor to limit or prohibit the exportation outside the State of municipal waste generated within the State.
