	<summary>
	2/3/1994--Introduced.
Amends the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1991 to revise the formula for the official mail allowance (thus, reducing the amount allowed) for Members of the House of Representatives. Prohibits the transfer of funds appropriated for official mail costs of the House. Prohibits any: (1) Member of Congress from sending any unsolicited franked mail (currently, franked mass mailings) postmarked fewer than 60 days immediately before any primary or general election in which such Member is a candidate; and (2) Representative who is a candidate for any other public office from sending unsolicited franked mail outside his or her congressional district. Repeals Federal law that makes frankable mail matter which consists of voter registration, election information, or assistance prepared and mailed in a nonpartisan manner. Requires any amount remaining in an official allowance of a Member of the House of Representatives at the end of the session of the Congress or other period for which the allowance is made available to be returned to the Treasury for deficit reduction.
