	<summary>
	4/28/1993--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to review Federal and State commercial motor vehicle weight limitations with respect to Federal-aid highways in Ohio. Requires the Secretary, if it is in the public interest, to waive Federal vehicle weight limitations to highways on the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways in Ohio for short wheel-base vehicles in order to permit a reasonable period of depreciation for such vehicles purchased before October 1, 1991. Prohibits the Secretary from withholding Ohio's apportionment of Federal highway funds for failure to comply with such limitations until he or she makes a determination with respect to the public interest requirement. Amends Federal transportation law to authorize Alaska to permit the operation of longer combination vehicles which were in operation prior to July 6, 1991 (currently, prior to July 5, 1991).
