8/21/1994--Introduced.
Amends the Flood Control Act of 1968 to allow user fees to be collected at lakes and reservoirs under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) only from users of highly developed facilities requiring continuous presence of maintenance and supervision personnel and to prohibit the collection of such fees for access to or use of water areas, undeveloped or lightly developed shoreland (including beaches), picnic grounds, overlook sites, scenic drives, or boat launching ramps where no mechanical or hydraulic equipment is provided. Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to require, at each Corps lake or reservoir at which camping is permitted, the provision of at least one campground with minimal facilities where no charge shall be imposed. Prohibits a law from being enacted providing for establishment and collection of fees by the Secretary of the Army for the use of developed recreation sites and facilities unless the law also requires that the fees collected at any facility be deposited into a special account established in the Treasury for carrying out activities at such facilities and that the funds deposited into such account only be expended at such facility for carrying out activities which generated such funds.
