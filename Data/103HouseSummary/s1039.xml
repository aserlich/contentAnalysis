Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to issue regulations requiring the use of child safety restraint systems on commercial aircraft. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the U.S. representative to the International Civil Aviation Organization should seek an international standard to require that airline passengers be restrained on takeoff and landing and when directed by the captain.
