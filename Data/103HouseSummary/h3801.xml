(Sec. 102) Limits a Member of the House to service on no more than two standing committees and four subcommittees thereof, with exceptions: (1) for the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct; (2) after notification of the appropriate party caucus and committee and House approval; and (3) with unanimous consent or approval of a privileged motion to waive the limitation with respect to an individual Member. Allows Members serving on the Committee on the Budget to: (1) serve on one other standing committee; and (2) take a leave of absence from service on any other committee or subcommittee without losing their seniority rights as if they had continued to serve on such committee or subcommittee. Requires the Committee on Rules to consider a resolution amending the Rules of the House to eliminate a standing committee and transfer its jurisdiction to one or more other standing committees if its membership for a Congress is below 50 percent of its membership at the end of the 103d Congress. Limits an exclusive or major committee (except the Committee on Appropriations) to five subcommittees and a nonmajor committee to four. Requires authorization by the House before a committee may establish any subunit other than a subcommittee. (Sec. 103) Expresses the sense of the House that there should be established a schedule of legislative activities of the House that: (1) provides for four full days of legislative business per week while the House is in session; (2) sets aside specific periods exclusively for floor proceedings and committee meetings and hearings; (3) rationalizes the scheduling of committee and subcommittee meetings and hearings to minimize conflicts; and (4) encourages and requires that the House Information Systems provide training on the use of computerized scheduling to minimize such conflicts.

(Sec. 104) Prohibits a committee's subcommittee from sitting when a meeting or hearings of such committee is in progress without the committee chairman's approval. (Sec. 105) Amends rule XXI to require a report from any committee accompanying any bill authorizing or providing obligational authority or tax expenditures or the joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report on such bill to contain a concise statement: (1) describing the effect of any provision of the bill or conference report which changes the application of existing law; and (2) to list in a separate and identifiable part of the report or joint explanatory statement, each item in such bill, report, conference report, or joint explanatory statement that earmarks the required use of funds below the appropriation account level or provides a specific tax expenditure. (Sec. 106) Requires: (1) the Committee on Appropriations to immediately notify the appropriate standing committee whenever the Committee orders reported any general appropriations bill that makes appropriations for any unauthorized expenditure, or that reappropriates unexpended balances of appropriations, within the jurisdiction of any other standing committee; (2) a House committee to notify such Committee whenever it reports any bill, resolution, or amendment thereto, carrying an appropriation from a committee not having jurisdiction to report appropriations; (3) such Committee to deliver copies of appropriation bills as passed the House with numbered Senate amendments to the appropriate authorizing committees at least 24 hours before requesting appointment of conferees thereon unless the Speaker determines otherwise; and (4) the Committee to deliver copies of the conference report and accompanying joint explanatory statement to the appropriate authorizing committees at least 24 hours before floor action thereon unless the Speaker determines otherwise.

Requires such Committee to adopt specified rules relating to the use of independent factfinders. (Sec. 109) Amends rule XLVIII to prohibit a Member of the House (other than the majority and minority leaders) from serving on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence for more than four Congresses in any period of six successive Congresses. Allows an incumbent chairman or ranking minority member who has served on the Select Committee for four Congresses and has served in such capacity for not more than one Congress to be eligible for reappointment as chairman or ranking minority member for one additional Congress. (Sec. 110) Amends rule X to require each standing committee of the House, by March 1 of the first session of a Congress, to submit (in conjunction with its committee expense resolution) to the Committee on House Administration an oversight agenda for that Congress addressing the Committee's oversight responsibilities with respect to reviewing and studying applicable laws, agencies, and programs within its jurisdiction. Authorizes each committee to request the assistance of the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) of the Library of Congress (LOC) in developing its oversight agenda. Requires the Committee on House Administration, by March 31 in the first session of a Congress, to publish and report to the House the oversight agenda submitted by each committee together with the Committee's recommendations.

Authorizes the Speaker, with approval of the House, to appoint special ad hoc oversight committees to review specific matters within the jurisdiction of two or more standing committees.

(Sec. 113) Expresses the sense of the House that specified steps should be taken to improve the public's understanding of the Congress and the legislative process. (Sec. 114) Expresses the sense of the House that the Committee on House Administration and the House Committee on Appropriations should conduct a study of the salary ranges of congressional personal, committee, and administrative staff with a view toward achieving bicameral salary parity for House and Senate staff performing analogous functions.
