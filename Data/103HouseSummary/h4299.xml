TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Intelligence Activities Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Title III: General Provisions Title IV: Central Intelligence Agency Title V: Department of Defense Intelligence Activities Title VI: Construction of Facilities for the Intelligence Community Title VII: Classification Management Title VIII: Counterintelligence and Security Title IX: Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the United States Intelligence Community Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 - Title I: Intelligence Activities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1995 for intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the: (1) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); (2) Department of Defense (DOD); (3) Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA); (4) National Security Agency (NSA); (5) National Reconnaissance Office; (6) Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; (7) Department of State; (8) Department of the Treasury; (9) Department of Energy; (10) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (11) Drug Enforcement Administration; and (12) Central Imagery Office. (Sec. 102) Specifies that the amounts authorized to be appropriated and the authorized personnel ceilings as of September 30, 1995, for intelligence-related activities are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations prepared to accompany the conference report on this bill. (Sec. 103) Authorizes FY 1995 appropriations for the Community Management Account of the Director of Central Intelligence. Authorizes full-time personnel for such Account. Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - Authorizes FY 1995 appropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund. Title III: General Provisions - Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for Federal employee compensation and benefits to be increased as necessary for increases in compensation or benefits authorized by law. (Sec. 302) Prohibits the authorization of appropriations by this Act from constituting authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. (Sec. 303) Expresses the sense of the Congress that the CIA Director should award contracts so as to maximize the procurement of products properly designated as having been made in the United States. (Sec. 304) Repeals a provision of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 which restricts U.S. intelligence cooperation with South Africa. (Sec. 305) Requires the CIA Director to submit to the congressional defense and intelligence committees a report on the advisability of mandatory retirement within the intelligence agencies for expiration of time in class comparable to provisions of the Foreign Service Act of 1980. Title IV: Central Intelligence Agency - Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to: (1) delete language prohibiting CIA payment of travel expenses for hospitalization and the costs of treatment of a CIA officer or employee when the injury is a result of vicious habits, intemperance, or misconduct; and (2) revise CIA Inspector General reporting requirements. (Sec. 403) Authorizes the CIA Director during FY 1995 to expend no more than $3 million of funds authorized under this Act to develop up to six products which demonstrate multimedia and graphical data interface techniques on topics of general interest to policy makers and the public. Requires submission to the congressional intelligence committees of products so developed. Title V: Department of Defense Intelligence Activities - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to delete references to the central imagery authority and to rename such authority as the Central Imagery Office. Applies to civilian personnel of such Office the current personnel management system for DIA civilian employees. (Sec. 502) Authorizes the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to withhold from public disclosure any geodetic product in DOD possession or control that contains information that would jeopardize or interfere with ongoing military or intelligence operations (as determined by the Director of the Defense Mapping Agency). (Sec. 503) States that DOD intelligence personnel shall not be required, outside the United States, to give notice of governmental affiliation to potential U.S. person sources during the initial assessment contact. Requires DOD to maintain records of such contact and to make them available to the appropriate congressional committees.
