Requires the Secretary to review reported information to determine trends relating to drugs and to report to compilers of the official compendia for consideration of revisions of packaging and labeling requirements and dissemination to health professionals. Imposes fines for reporting to or requesting information from the data bank under false pretenses and for gaining access to the data bank unlawfully. Prescribes penalties for failing to make required reports.
