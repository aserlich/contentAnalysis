	10/6/1994--Introduced.
National Park Service Employee Housing Program Act of 1994 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to: (1) provide housing to employees of the National Park Service (Service) only when and where such housing is necessary and justified; and (2) ensure that such housing is available and adequate. Requires the Secretary to: (1) review and revise the existing criteria under which housing is provided to Service employees; (2) use the revised criteria to undertake a review of the physical condition and suitability of existing federally-owned housing provided to Service employees for each National Park System (NPS) unit; and (3) report to specified congressional committees on the review and on a plan to meet employee housing needs. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into housing agreements with housing entities concerning the reviewed NPS units under which the entities may develop, construct, rehabilitate, or manage housing located on or off public lands in areas designated for administrative use for rent or lease to Service employees who meet this Act's housing eligibility criteria. Prohibits the acquisition of private lands pursuant to this Act without the owner's consent. Requires the Secretary to undertake a study to determine the feasibility of providing eligible Service employees with housing allowances rather than Federal housing. Authorizes the Secretary to institute a program for the provision of the allowances, subject to the availability of funds, if it would be beneficial to the Government. Authorizes appropriations.
