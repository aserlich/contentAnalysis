	<summary>
	6/21/1994--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make grants to State, interstate, regional, and local entities for projects that demonstrate innovative and cost-effective technologies and methods for reducing discharges from combined sewer overflows into navigable waters of interstate significance. Requires the Administrator, in awarding such grants, to give priority consideration to projects that provide for the transfer of technologies to other areas of the United States. Sets the maximum Federal share of project costs at: (1) 100 percent of the cost of a feasibility study; (2) 80 percent of the cost of engineering and design; and (3) 80 percent of the cost of construction. Authorizes appropriations.
