Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1993 - Provides that not later than 30 days after a lobbyist first makes or agrees to make a lobbying contact with a covered legislative or executive branch official, such lobbyist, or as provided below, the organization employing such lobbyist, shall register with the Office of Lobbying Registration and Public Disclosure (OLRAPD). Provides that any person whose income or expenses in connection with lobbying activities on behalf of a particular client do not exceed, or are not expected to exceed, $1,000 in a semiannual period is not required to register for such client. Defines &quot;lobbyist&quot; as any individual who is employed or retained by another for financial or other compensation to perform services that include lobbying contacts, other than an individual whose lobbying activities are only incidental to, and not a significant part of, the services for which such individual is paid. Specifies the information that such registration shall contain. Provides that in the case of a registrant representing more than one client, a separate registration shall be filed for each client represented. Requires organizations whose employees are lobbyists to file a single registration. Requires registrants to file with OLRAPD a report on semiannual lobbying activities. Establishes within the Department of Justice OLRAPD the duties of which include: (1) prescribing rules for implementing this Act; (2) making registrations and reports public; and (3) transmitting annual reports to the Congress and President. Establishes procedures for: (1) informal resolution of alleged noncompliance; (2) determinations of noncompliance where information provided to OLRAPD indicates that noncompliance may exist; and (3) addressing late registrations and filings and failures to provide such information. Provides for judicial review of certain OLRAPD decisions. Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 to: (1) revise the definition of &quot;foreign principal&quot;; (2) eliminate references to political propaganda and, in certain cases, replace such references with references to informational materials; and (3) modify the registration exemption for lawyers providing legal representation to disclosed foreign principals to apply such exemption to judicial proceedings and criminal or civil law enforcement inquiries, investigations, or proceedings. Revises limitations on use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracting and financial transactions. Repeals the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act. Repeals provisions under the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act and Public Utility Holding Company Act relating to lobbyist activities. Authorizes appropriations.
