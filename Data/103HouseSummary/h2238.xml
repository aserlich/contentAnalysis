(Sec. 1002) Revises competition requirements, among other changes prohibiting purchase or contract class considerations by subject agencies in determining whether the exclusion of a particular source of covered items from competition in procurements to establish alternative sources of supply will result in reduced costs and increased competition or be in the interest of national defense. (Sec. 1003) Revises certain qualifying circumstances for award of contracts between $100,000 and $1 million under noncompetitive procedures. (Sec. 1011) Revises solicitation requirements, among other changes requiring the head of a subject agency to: (1) include cost or price as a factor to be considered in evaluating competitive proposals; and (2) disclose certain information to offerors on the importance of other evaluation factors in relation to cost and price. (Sec. 1012) Relocates provisions concerning purchase option evaluation. (Sec. 1013) Modifies notice requirements, providing, among other changes, for notice by electronic means.

Subtitle B: Truth in Negotiations - Part I: Armed Services Acquisitions - Amends Federal law (Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA)) to revise cost or pricing data requirements to: (1) repeal the sunset date for the requirement that offerors submit cost or pricing data for prime contracts above the $500,000 threshold (thus making it permanent); (2) provide for periodic inflation adjustments in such threshold; and (3) make changes in exceptions to data submission requirements. (Sec. 1204) Provides for consistent time references with respect to when an agreement on the price of a prime contract is effective for purposes related to contract price reductions because of defective data. Part II: Civilian Agency Acquisitions - Amends FPASA to replace requirements governing submission of cost or pricing data and commercial pricing for supplies with requirements similar to those under TINA (and the changes made above by this subtitle to TINA) governing submission of such data.

Subtitle D: Procurement Protests - Part I: Protests to the Comptroller General - Modifies CICA's procurement protest system by: (1) adding a new definition of &quot;protest&quot;; (2) establishing new time frames for certain actions by the CG and others with respect to protests; (3) allowing the CG, in protests, to recommend agency payment of interested party consultant and expert witness fees, in addition to attorneys' fee currently required; (4) requiring subject agencies to pay recommended amounts or else report to the CG the reasons for failing to do so; (5) directing the CG to report to the Congress on agency implementation of CG recommendations; (6) authorizing the CG to prescribe procedures for time frame calculations and electronic filings and disseminations under the system; and (7) permitting the CG to hold protesters liable for the costs of reviewing frivolous or bad faith protests and to issue protective orders restricting access to certain procurement information. Part II: Protests in Procurements of Automatic Data Processing - Amends FPASA to: (1) authorize the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to revoke a delegation of procurement authority after a contract is awarded when the award is connected with a violation of law; (2) require GSA's board of contract appeals (board), upon an interested party's request, to review any decision by a contracting officer alleged to have violated the law or the conditions of delegated authority; and (3) change time frames for final board decisions on protests and hearings for suspending procurement authority. (Sec. 1434) Authorizes: (1) dismissal of frivolous and bad faith protests; (2) board ordered payment of additional specified fees to prevailing parties; and (3) board imposed procedural sanctions for willful abuses of the board's process during a protest.

(Sec. 1554) States that the laws of the United States are amended to read as if the following had not been enacted: (1) certain general provisions of the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act, 1993 concerning departments, agencies, and corporations; and (2) certain provisions of a similarly named 1994 appropriations Act concerning independent agencies. (Sec. 1555) Authorizes the GSA Administrator to provide: (1) to qualified nonprofit agencies for the blind or other severely handicapped under the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (JWO), upon request, any of the services he or she is currently authorized to perform for other Federal agencies, mixed ownership corporations, or the District of Columbia (District) under FPASA; and (2) for the use of GSA supply schedules by State or local governments, the District, Puerto Rico, or Indian tribal governments, upon request, and subject to appropriate reimbursement of GSA for administrative costs incurred in such use.

Part II: Simplification of Procedures - Amends OFPPA to: (1) require executive agency heads awarding contracts exceeding the micro-purchase threshold (MPT) ($2,500, adjusted periodically for inflation) to ensure that procuring activities comply with Small Business Act (SBA) and other applicable Federal requirements; (2) exempt purchases not exceeding MPT from Buy American Act (BAA) requirements; and (3) revise procurement notice requirements, among other changes exempting from such requirements procurements for which notice is accomplished through FACNET.

Subtitle C: Miscellaneous Acquisition Laws - Amends subject and civilian agency (FPASA) law to declare that it is the policy of Congress that no legislation should be enacted that requires procurements to be made from a specified non-Federal source, unless the law identifies the non-Federal source involved and states that the procurement contravenes such policy. Title V: Standards of Conduct - Amends OFPPA to prohibit the use of consultants to conduct evaluations or analyses of any aspect of an acquisition proposal if qualified Federal employees are available for the job.
