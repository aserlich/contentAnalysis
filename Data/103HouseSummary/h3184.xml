	9/29/1993--Introduced.
Semiautomatic Assault Weapon Violence Prevention Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal criminal code to: (1) make it unlawful to transfer or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon; and (2) list weapons classified as semiautomatic assault weapons. Makes this Act inapplicable to the transfer or possession of a weapon: (1) by a Federal or State agency; (2) that was lawfully possessed before this Act's enactment or, in the case of a semiautomatic firearm designated as a semiautomatic assault weapon under this Act, before the designation is made; or (3) by a licensed manufacturer or importer for purposes of authorized testing or experimentation. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to designate a rifle, pistol, or shotgun that is a semiautomatic firearm and meets specified criteria as a semiautomatic assault weapon. Requires the serial numbers of such weapons to clearly show if they were manufactured or imported after this Act's effective date.
