	<summary>
	1/21/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Hobbs Act to redefine the term &quot;extortion&quot; to mean obtaining the property of another: (1) by threatening or placing another person in fear that any person will be subjected to bodily injury or kidnapping or that property will be damaged; or (2) under color of official right. States that the coincidence of a labor dispute and an act of bodily injury to a person (or damage to property) does not constitute prima facie evidence that property was obtained by extortion.
