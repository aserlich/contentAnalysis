	6/10/1993--Introduced.
Federal Employee Antistalking Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal criminal code to set penalties for persons who: (1) repeatedly engage in a pattern of conduct directed at an officer or employee in the executive or legislative branch of Government (including the U.S. Postal Service) while such officer or employee is engaged in, or on account of, official duties; (2) know or should know that such conduct is likely to place that officer or employee in reasonable fear of sexual battery, bodily injury, or death; and (3) thereby induce such fear. Specifies that if a sentence of probation is imposed the court shall require the defendant to undergo appropriate psychiatric, psychological, or social counseling. Allows an aggrieved officer or employee to obtain appropriate relief in a civil action, including punitive damages (in the case of a violation) and reasonable attorney's fees.
