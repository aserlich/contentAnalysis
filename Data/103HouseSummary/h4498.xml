TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: AFDC Amendments Title II: Housing Amendments Title III: Food Stamp Amendment Title IV: Head Start Amendment Title V: Effective Date Job Start for America Act of 1994 - Title I: AFDC Amendments - Amends part A of title IV (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require each State agency to provide to the caretaker relative of each first phase family (as defined by this Act) vouchers entitling any child care provider meeting applicable State and local standards to State payments equal to the provider's cost of providing child care with respect to the family. (Sec. 101) Provides for continuance of AFDC benefits for first phase and second phase families (as defined by this Act) for: (1) two years after the principal earner parent becomes gainfully employed; or (2) six months after the family income exceeds 300 percent of the poverty line. Disregards the assets of a spouse who marries an AFDC recipient for the first six months after the wedding. (Sec. 103) Increases from $1,000 (or any State-determined lower amount) to $2,500 the eligibility resource threshold for receipt of AFDC benefits. (Sec. 104) Requires a State plan to provide that a State agency shall provide job training and job search counseling to all AFDC recipients, including educational activities, job skills training, job readiness activities, job development, and job placement. Sets priorities for provision of job training and job search counseling, first to all first phase families, then to all second phase families, then to any family neither one nor the other. (Sec. 105) Defines: (1) first phase family as one whose principal earner parent has never been gainfully employed for three or more months (whether or not consecutive); and (2) second phase family as one whose principal earner parent has graduated from secondary school or received a high school equivalency certificate, but has never been gainfully employed. (Sec. 106) Repeals: (1) part F of SSA title IV (Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) Training Programs); and (2) requirements for treating families differently based on the number of parents in the home. Title II: Housing Amendments - Prohibits for a 24-month period any rent increase for a qualified dwelling unit because of increased income due to employment with respect to a family: (1) whose income increases as a result of the employment of a family member who was previously unemployed; and (2) who was receiving AFDC payments immediately before such employment. Title III: Food Stamp Amendment - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to exclude for food stamp eligibility purposes all earned income of a household that includes a member who is employed and who in the most recent two-year period participated fully in a State job training and job search counseling program under this Act, unless the household's aggregate income exceeds the poverty line by more than 300 percent. Title IV: Head Start Amendment - Amends the Head Start Act to authorize appropriations for full-day and full-year services. Title V: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective date of this Act.
