	4/28/1993--Introduced.
Airport and Airway Trust Fund Integrity Act of 1993 - Declares that the receipts and disbursements of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund allocable to transportation-related operations shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of: (1) the budget of the United States as presented by the President; (2) the congressional budget; or (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act). Exempts the fund from sequestration orders. Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to prohibit the Senate or the House of Representatives from considering any concurrent resolution on the budget or reconciliation bill that would treat the Airport and Airway Trust Fund as part of the Federal budget.
