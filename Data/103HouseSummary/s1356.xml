(Defines a &quot;new prison&quot; as a prison: (1) or city or county detention facility, including an addition to an existing prison or city or county detention facility, certified by the State and approved by the Attorney General as providing additional prison capacity beyond that which the State previously had available or had already planned to construct; and (2) that is principally dedicated to housing repeat violent offenders and sex offenders.) Authorizes the Attorney General to pay up to half of construction and operating costs. Sets forth provisions regarding the canceling and distribution of grants. Authorizes appropriations. Chapter 3: Judicial Remedies for Prison Crowding - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit a Federal court from: (1) holding prison or jail crowding unconstitutional under the eighth amendment except to the extent that an individual plaintiff inmate proves that the crowding causes the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment of that inmate, and limit relief to that necessary to remove the conditions causing such punishment of such inmate; and (2) placing a ceiling on the inmate population of any Federal, State, or local detention facility as an equitable remedial measure for conditions that violate the eighth amendment unless crowding is inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on particular identified prisoners.

Chapter 4: Sentences to Account for Costs to the Government of Imprisonment, Release, and Probation - Amends the Federal criminal and judicial codes, respectively, to: (1) require the court, in determining whether to impose a fine, to consider the expected costs to the Government of any imprisonment, supervised release, or probation component of the sentence; and (2) authorize the U.S. Sentencing Commission to include, as a component of a fine, the expected costs to the Government of any imprisonment, supervised release, or probation sentence that is ordered.

(Sec. 303) Restricts defenses to deportation for certain criminal aliens based on seven years of permanent residence and based on withholding of deportation or return to a country where such alien's life or freedom would be threatened.

Title IV: Gangs, Juveniles, Drugs, and Prosecutors - Anti-Gang and Youth Protection Act of 1993 - Subtitle A: Criminal Youth Gangs - Amends the Federal criminal code to make it unlawful to: (1) commit specified &quot;predicate gang crimes&quot; (including murder, assault, kidnapping, arson, and retaliating against a witness, victim, or informant) with intent to promote or further the activities of a criminal street gang (gang) or for the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position in such gang; (2) participate in, or induce another to participate in, a gang; (3) employ any individual to commit or facilitate the commission of a predicate gang crime with such intent; or (4) use any communication facility in causing or facilitating the commission of such an offense with such intent. Sets penalties for such offenses. Provides for forfeiture of proceeds obtained from, and property used to commit, the violation. Authorizes the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury to investigate such offenses. Directs the Sentencing Commission to increase the base offense level for any felony committed for the purpose of gaining entrance into, or maintaining or increasing position in, a criminal street gang.

Directs the court, in considering the nature of the offense, to consider the extent to which the juvenile played a leadership role in an organization, or otherwise influenced other persons to take part in criminal activities, involving the use or distribution of controlled substances or firearms (which factor, if found to exist, shall weigh heavily in favor of transfer to adult status, but its absence shall not preclude such a transfer). (Sec. 415) Increases penalties under: (1) the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) for employing children to distribute drugs near schools and playgrounds, and for drug trafficking near public housing; and (2) the Federal criminal code for Travel Act crimes involving violence and conspiracy to commit contract killings.

Title V: Drug Control and Rural Crime - Subtitle A: Drug Trafficking in Rural Areas - Amends the Omnibus Act to: (1) authorize appropriations for rural drug law enforcement assistance; and (2) increase the base allocation to each nonrural State. (Sec. 502) Directs the Attorney General to establish a Rural Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force in each of the Federal judicial districts that encompass significant rural lands. (Sec. 503) Authorizes the Attorney General to cross-designate up to 100 law enforcement officers from agencies with jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of the CSA on non-Federal lands and the Federal criminal code to the extent necessary to effect the purposes of this Act. Directs the Attorney General to ensure that each of the task forces are adequately staffed.

Redefines &quot;regulated transaction&quot; to mean any transaction in a listed chemical that is contained in a drug that may be marketed or distributed lawfully in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as under current law) unless: (1) the drug contains ephedrine as the only active medicinal ingredient or contains ephedrine and therapeutically insignificant quantities of another active medicinal ingredient; or (2) the Attorney General has determined that the drug or group of drugs is being diverted to obtain the listed chemical for use in the illicit production of a controlled substance; and (3) the quantity of ephedrine or other listed chemical contained in the drug included in the transaction or multiple transactions equals or exceeds the threshold established for that chemical by the Attorney General. Defines: (1) &quot;international transaction&quot; to mean a transaction involving the shipment of a listed chemical across an international (other than a U.S.) border in which a broker or trader located in the United States participates; and (2) &quot;broker&quot; and &quot;trader&quot; to mean a person that assists in arranging an international transaction in a listed chemical by negotiating contracts, serving as an agent or intermediary, or bringing together a buyer and seller, buyer, and transporter, or a seller and transporter.

Sets forth provisions regarding factors to be considered, specificity of designation, reinstatement of exemption with respect to particular drug products, and status pending application for reinstatement. (Sec. 533) Authorizes the Attorney General to promulgate rules and regulations and to charge reasonable fees relating to the registration and control of regulated persons and regulated transactions. Directs the Attorney General to register an applicant to distribute, and to import or export, a list I chemical unless the Attorney General determines that registration of the applicant is inconsistent with the public interest, with exceptions. Prohibits regulated persons from knowingly or intentionally distributing, importing, or exporting a list I chemical without the registration required by the Act.
