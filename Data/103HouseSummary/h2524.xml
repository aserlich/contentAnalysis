Repeals provisions of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 concerning the market promotion program. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to eliminate the tobacco price support program. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to eliminate parity payments and specified tobacco marketing quotas and quota adjustment programs.

Repeals the National Wool Act of 1954. Eliminates the honey and peanut price support programs. Repeals peanut marketing quota and quota adjustment provisions. Subjects production of locatable minerals from a claim located on lands open to mineral entry under the Mining Law of 1872 to an annual royalty of at least five percent of the gross income from production. Voids claims for failures to pay royalties and prohibits a claimant from locating a new claim on lands included in the abandoned claim for one year. Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to direct the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to establish an annual domestic livestock grazing fee for national forest and public lands. Makes fees available for restoration and enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat, restoration and management of riparian areas, and implementation of grazing plans and regulations.

Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 to require the President to enter into revised host-nation defense burdensharing agreements. Requires such countries to assume at least 75 percent (currently, an increased share) of the costs of U.S. military installations, excluding the costs of military and civilian personnel. Removes an exemption from defense burdensharing requirements for countries that receive specified assistance under the Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.
