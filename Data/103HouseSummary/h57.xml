	1/5/1993--Introduced.
United States Merchant Marine Utilization and Preference Act of 1993 - Requires Department of Defense (DOD) cargoes to be transported by water in the following order of priority under conditions other than full or partial mobilization declared by the President: (1) use of privately owned U.S. flag vessels that operate in U.S. liner or tramp trades and not chartered by the Government; (2) time or voyage charter of privately owned U.S. flag vessels operating in liner service providing partial or total space available or in tramp service if they are voluntarily made available to DOD; (3) vessels in the nucleus fleet; and (4) foreign flag vessels. Limits the use of time and voyage charters to a minimum necessary to meet requirements which can not be met by U.S. flag liner or tramp operators. Applies the tariff filed by a person with the Federal Maritime Commission under the Shipping Act of 1916 or of 1984 to transportation of DOD cargo on any U.S. flag-vessel that is operated by that person, with exceptions. Makes the Military Sealift Command the sole manager for ocean transportation of DOD cargoes. Prohibits DOD from engaging in competition with private persons in the provision of transportation by water in commercial service except as provided under this Act. Directs the Secretary of Defense to maintain a fleet of vessels (the &quot;nucleus fleet&quot;) to meet military requirements. Places a vessel in the nucleus fleet in reduced operating status if it is inactive for a 30-day period. Sets forth additional requirements for the deactivation of vessels. Prescribes guidelines for the inclusion of additional numbers and types of vessels in the nucleus fleet under conditions of full mobilization. Amends the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 to authorize the use of Ready Reserve Force vessels of the National Defense Reserve Fleet in peacetime for routine movements of cargo as part of military exercises only if such use does not compete with U.S. flag commercial vessel operators.
