	<summary>
	5/11/1994--Conference report filed in House. TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Toy Labeling Requirements Title II: Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Child Safety Protection Act - Title I: Toy Labeling Requirements - Requires warning labels on the packaging of children's toys and games with small parts, balloons, small balls, or marbles. Establishes general labeling requirements, including that any required cautionary statement be displayed in English, in conspicuous and legible type (consistent with specified Federal regulations), and in its entirety on the principal display panel of the product's package, on any descriptive material accompanying the product, in the case of bulk sales of such product when unpackaged, on any bin, any container for retail display, and any vending machine from which the product is dispensed. Sets forth exceptions, including for products manufactured outside the United States. Treats a balloon, ball, marble, toy, or game that is not in compliance with labeling requirements as a misbranded hazardous substance. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) preemption; (2) reporting requirements; and (3) confidentiality. Title II: Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety - Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1994 - Authorizes the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make grants to States, political subdivisions, and nonprofit organizations for programs that require or encourage individuals under the age of 16 to wear approved bicycle helmets. Requires bicycle helmets to meet specified interim Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) standards and provides for the setting of a final standard. Considers failure to meet such a standard to be a violation of a consumer product safety standard promulgated under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Authorizes appropriations.
