	11/15/1993--Passed House amended. Ban on Smoking in Federal Buildings Act - Prohibits smoking in buildings owned or leased for use by a Federal agency except in areas, as may be designated by agencies, that are ventilated: (1) separately from other portions of the building; (2) using a method determined by the Administrator of General Services to be at least as effective as such; or (3) in accordance with Federal indoor air quality standards for environmental tobacco smoke, if such standards are in effect. Directs the Administrator of General Services (with respect to the executive branch), the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (with respect to the judicial branch), and the House Office Building Commission, the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate, and the Architect of the Capitol (with respect to the legislative branch) to take such actions as necessary to institute and enforce such prohibition. Requires the Administrator to report to specified congressional committees with information concerning the degree of compliance with this Act and on research and development on methods of ventilation which are at least as effective as the method described in this Act. Specifies that nothing in this Act is intended to preempt any provision of State or local law that is more restrictive than a provision of this Act.
