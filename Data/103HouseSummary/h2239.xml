	<summary>
	7/20/1993--Passed House amended. Securities and Exchange Commission Authorization Act of 1993 - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to authorize appropriations for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for FY 1994 and 1995. Requires the SEC to adjust annually the rates of registration, transaction, proxy filing, and other related fees in order to secure a total amount of collections that offsets the amounts appropriated to it (and the applicable surplus amounts if any). Prescribes a fee adjustment mechanism. Exempts such fee determinations and adjustments from judicial review. Requires the SEC to submit explanatory reports to the Congress before the effective date of any adjustment. Directs the SEC to study and report to the Congress on the structure and procedures for such fee collection.
