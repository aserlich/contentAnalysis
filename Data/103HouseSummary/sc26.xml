	5/24/1993--Introduced.
Many Neighbors, One Earth Resolution - Urges the President to develop and implement a coordinated economic and development policy and program of action designed to promote broadbased, sustainable development. Specifies that such policy and program should have as principal objectives: (1) expanding economic opportunities; (2) meeting basic human needs; (3) promoting environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources; and (4) promoting pluralism, democratic participation, and human rights. Specifies that such policy and program should involve all relevant international activities of the U.S. Government. Urges specific actions that the President should take, including: (1) working with the Congress to enact legislation providing for a post-Cold War foreign assistance program that would have as its primary purpose the promotion of sustainable development; (2) ensuring that development cooperation programs, conform to such objectives in ways that invigorate local community-based development through taking into account relevant local perspectives of its beneficiaries during the design, planning, implementation, and evaluation process for project and program assistance; (3) providing government-to-government assistance only to countries that exhibit a commitment to development that promotes such objectives, with priority to countries with the highest incidence of hunger and poverty; and (4) encouraging and supporting the efforts of countries to reduce their levels of military spending when such spending is disproportionate to security needs and spending on health, education, and environmental protection.
