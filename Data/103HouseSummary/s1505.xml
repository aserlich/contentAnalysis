	9/30/1993--Introduced.
Natural Resource Employment Transition Assistance Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to require the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) include a detailed economic impact statement with each notice published in the Federal Register of a proposal to withdraw lands from the operation of public land laws; and (2) prepare a record of decision for each withdrawal decision. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to States, substate grantees, employers, employer associations, and labor organizations to: (1) provide training, adjustment assistance, and employment services to adversely affected workers because of such withdrawal; and (2) make needs-related payments to them to complete training or education programs in accordance with this Act. Specifies as entities eligible for designation as substate grantees: (1) private industry councils in a substate area designated by the Governor of the State involved; (2) service delivery area grant recipients or administrative entities; (3) private nonprofit organizations; (4) units of general local government in the substate area, or agencies thereof; (5) local offices of State agencies; and (6) other public agencies, such as community colleges and area vocational schools. Prohibits a grant from being awarded to an applicant without assurances that a portion of it will be used to provide training, adjustment assistance, employment services, and needs-related payments to adversely affected workers in rural areas. Sets forth provisions relating to priority and approval of applications for the grants. Authorizes the use of such grants for: (1) any purpose under specified provisions of the Job Training Partnership Act; and (2) job search allowance for an adversely affected worker, under specified conditions. Requires a grantee of such award to provide employment counseling and referral to training programs, if needed, to an adversely affected worker who qualifies for unemployment benefits pursuant to this Act. Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to assess and report to the Congress on the effects on Federal land management, natural resources, and employment that are attributable to compliance with such Act and any other Federal land management and resource policies. Authorizes appropriations.
