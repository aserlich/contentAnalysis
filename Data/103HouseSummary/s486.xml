	11/19/1993--Passed Senate amended. Reorganization of the Federal Administrative Judiciary Act - Establishes an Administrative Law Judge Corps. Transfers to the Corps all current administrative law judges (ALJs). States that the chief ALJ shall be the chief administrative officer of the Corps as well as its presiding judge. Specifies the qualifications for chief judge. States that such judge shall be appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. Makes the chief judge responsible for developing programs and practices which foster economy and efficiency in the processing of cases heard by ALJs, including programs to train judges, employ information technology, consolidate hearing facilities and law libraries, and foster efficient use of staff, personnel, equipment, and facilities. Establishes eight divisions within the Corps, with each division headed by a division chief judge appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. Identifies the divisions and their respective areas of jurisdiction. Specifies qualifications required for division chief judges. States that the Corps' policymaking body shall be the Council of the Corps comprised of the chief judge and the division chief judges. Authorizes the Council to: (1) assign judges to divisions and to transfer or reassign judges from one division to another; (2) appoint persons as ALJs and members of the Corps; (3) file charges against an ALJ; (4) prescribe certain rules of practice and procedure for proceedings before the Corps; (5) issue rules and regulations for the efficient conduct of the Corps; and (6) perform other administrative functions. Directs the Council to appoint new judges from a register maintained by the Office of Personnel Management. Confers jurisdiction upon members of the Corps to adjudicate cases under specified sections of the Administrative Procedure Act. Requires cases arising under such sections to be referred to the Corps. Sets forth guidelines for: (1) referrals by agencies and courts; and (2) the removal and discipline of ALJs.

Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to monitor and report to the Congress concerning financial outlays and balances resulting from functions transferred under this Act.
