TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Building Restoration and Preservation Title II: Cooper Hall and Science Hall Preservation and Restoration Title I: Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Building Restoration and Preservation - Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Building Restoration and Preservation Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to administer a program of grants-in-aid, from amounts authorized to be appropriated to carry out the National Historic Preservation Act for FY 1995 through 1998, to eligible historically black colleges and universities for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures on their campuses. Requires a grantee to covenant, for the period of time specified by the Secretary, that: (1) no alteration will be made in the property with respect to which the grant is made without the concurrence of the Secretary; and (2) reasonable public access will be permitted to such property for interpretive and educational purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) obligate funds for a grant with respect to a building or structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places only if the grantee agrees to match the amount of such grant, with funds derived from non-Federal sources; and (2) waive this matching requirement if an extreme emergency exists or that such a waiver is in the public interest to assure the preservation of historically significant resources. Limits amounts made available for this Act for FY 1995 through 1998. Earmarks funds for FY 1995 for grants to: (1) Fisk University; and (2) historically black colleges and universities identified for inclusion in the Department of the Interior Historically Black College and University Historic Preservation Initiative.
