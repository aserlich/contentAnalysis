Emergency Climate Stabilization and Earth Regeneration Act of 1992 - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to establish a process through which the Congress and the President shall cooperate in a national and international program to: (1) reduce heat, drought, famine, tornadoes, and forest fires and to decrease the freezing extremes, snow buildup, flooding, cloud cover, and storms in the winter; (2) regenerate the earth through reforestation, soil and ocean remineralization, conservation, and alternative energy technology development; (3) maximize food and agricultural security; and (4) create a secure, environmentally sustainable way of life consistent with long-term climate stabilization. Sets forth specific ways to achieve reduction of carbon dioxide. Directs the President to provide for a climatic stabilization program and for information development and processing centers to process data concerning world climatic conditions. Directs the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate to take steps to establish a Joint Committee on Climate Stabilization. Establishes a Council on Climate Stabilization and Earth Regeneration as an independent Federal agency. Requires the President to provide for a unified crisis management operation to minimize damage from, and to maintain agricultural and industrial production under, changing atmospheric conditions that cause natural disasters. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a corporate tax surcharge. Terminates such tax for tax years after December 31, 1996. Establishes a Climate Stabilization Trust Fund to be composed of the amount of corporate tax surcharges received in the Treasury. Makes the Fund available to carry out this Act. Authorizes appropriations.
