Permits a candidate to spend: (1) an additional $200,000 in a runoff election; (2) $600,000 in a special election; and (3) an additional $200,000 in a closely contested primary. Waives such limits for a candidate whose opponent is not participating in such spending limitations and receives contributions or makes expenditures in excess of 25 percent of election cycle limits. Exempts from such limits legal, tax, accounting, and fund raising costs. Sets forth graduated civil penalties for different levels of excess expenditures. Limits a candidate's personal campaign contributions in an election cycle to $50,000. Waives such limits in the case of a nonparticipating opponent who exceeds such limits. States that the Federal Election Commission (Commission) shall determine a candidate's eligibility to participate in the voluntary program of spending and contribution limits established by this Act. Entitles an eligible candidate to up to $200,000 in voter communication vouchers. Sets forth eligibility requirements, including: (1) having raised at least ten percent of contributions from individual contributions; and (2) general election ballot qualification of both the candidate and his or her opponent. Permits voucher use to purchase: (1) broadcast time; (2) print advertisements; (3) voter contact campaign materials; and (4) postage. Increases voucher amounts available to a candidate who has at least $10,000 in independent expenditures made against him or her or in favor of another candidate. Prohibits conversion of voucher funds for personal or family use. Requires a candidate's television commercials to permit closed captioning. Requires the Commission to examine and audit for FECA compliance five percent of all House candidates. Provides for judicial review of Commission actions and requires Commission reports to the House. (Sec. 122) Provides for the registration of eligible candidates. Title II: Limitations on Political Committees and Large Donor Contributions That May Be Accepted by House of Representatives Candidates - Amends FECA to limit a candidate to accepting in an election cycle not more than $200,000 in aggregate from each of: (1) political parties; and (2) persons other than political parties whose contributions total more than $200. Sets forth graduated civil monetary penalties for acceptance of low, medium, and large excess contributions. Requires annual limit indexing. Title III: Independent Expenditures - Amends FECA to define &quot;independent expenditure&quot; as an expenditure for an advertisement or other communication that: (1) contains express advocacy; and (2) is made without the participation or cooperation of a candidate or a candidate's representative. Excludes from the meaning of &quot;independent expenditure&quot; any expenditure by: (1) a political committee of a political party; (2) persons who communicate or receive information about activities that have a purpose of influencing a candidate's election; and (3) persons with other specified relationships with a candidate or candidate's agents in the same election cycle. Defines &quot;express advocacy&quot; as any communication that when taken as a whole: (1) expresses support for or opposition to a specific candidate, a specific group of candidates, or candidates of a particular political party; or (2) suggests taking action with respect to an election, such as voting for or against, contributing to, or participating in campaign activity. (Sec. 302) Sets forth reporting requirements for certain independent expenditures. (Sec. 303) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a broadcast or cable station to notify a candidate and offer equal broadcast opportunity if an independent communications expenditure has been made against such candidate. Title IV: Contributions and Expenditures By Political Party Committees - Amends FECA to define: (1) &quot;generic campaign activity&quot; as a campaign activity on behalf of a party rather than a candidate; and (2) &quot;State Party Grass Roots Fund&quot; as a segregated State fund on behalf of a federal candidate. (Sec. 402) Permits maximum contributions to a State Party Grassroots Fund of: (1) $20,000 by an individual; and (2) $15,000 from a multicandidate committee. Establishes an overall $60,000 annual limit on individual contributions, including specified limits for: (1) candidates and their political committees; and (2) State committees. (Sec. 403) Subjects to certain limitations, prohibitions and reporting requirements any amount (&quot;soft money&quot;) solicited, received, or expended directly or indirectly by a national, State, district, or local committee of a political party (including any subordinate committee) with respect to an activity (such as voter registration and get-out-the vote activities, among others) which, in whole or in part, is in connection with an election to Federal office. Prohibits a national political party committee and a congressional campaign committee from soliciting or accepting contributions not subject to FECA limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements.
