Farm Viability and Pest Management Improvement Act of 1994: A National Program for Pesticide Reduction - Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a pesticide reduction council in each EPA region. Directs the Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out specified activities with respect to assessing and approving integrated pest management systems and pesticide reduction plans and goals and implementing programs to assist farmers in adopting such systems. Requires the Administrator to reduce or restrict the use of pesticides that contribute significant health and environmental risks or to amend labels of such pesticides in regions where goals of this Act have not been met. Requires the Administrator to set quantitative goals for reducing or eliminating the use of nonagricultural pesticides and carry out plans to achieve such goals within six years. Directs Federal agencies to establish pesticide reduction goals and to implement integrated pest management systems. Requires the Secretary to determine the percentage of food purchases throughout the United States that are organically produced. Directs Federal agencies to develop procurement plans that ensure that the percentage of an agency's purchase of organically produced food meets or exceeds such percentage, and meets or exceeds twice such percentage, within three and six years of this Act's enactment, respectively. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator to establish a national pesticide use recordkeeping and reporting system for agricultural and nonagricultural applications. Imposes penalties for violations of recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Repeals certain existing pesticide recordkeeping requirements. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the goal of: (1) all pest and weed management research and extension activities within the Agricultural Research Service and the Cooperative Extension Service is the development and transfer of technology related to integrated pest management systems that reduce pesticide use; and (2) pest management research by the National Research Initiative in the areas of plant systems and natural resources and environment is development of biological, cultural, and other nonchemical methods of pest control that reduce pesticide use. Requires the Secretary to adopt regulations establishing priorities and resource allocations for competitive grants research in integrated pest management systems. Allocates at least ten percent of Agricultural Conservation Program funding for the integrated crop management program.
