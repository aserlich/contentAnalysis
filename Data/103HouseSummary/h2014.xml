	<summary>
	5/6/1993--Introduced.
Value Engineering Better Transportation Act of 1993 - Amends Federal transportation law and the Federal Transit Act to increase by five percent increments (up to 100 percent) the Federal share for transportation projects costing over $2 million for which &quot;value engineering&quot; results in certain minimum project cost savings. Prohibits the use of Federal funds for &quot;value engineering&quot; training. Defines &quot;value engineering&quot; as the process of review and analysis of a project during its design phase by a multidisciplined team of persons not originally involved in the project in order to provide suggestions for reducing total project costs and providing better quality.
