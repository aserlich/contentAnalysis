Clean Fuels Infrastructure and Incentives Act of 1993 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program for providing grants to eligible States to fund the construction of clean fuel refueling facilities in certain ozone nonattainment areas. Authorizes appropriations. Provides for the distribution of funds based on the pro rata number of licensed motor vehicles in a State. Limits the total amount of funds to be received by a State. Requires recipient States to distribute at least 50 percent of funds for the installation of clean fuel refueling facilities in the private sector. Makes a State eligible for a grant only if it has: (1) submitted a revision of the applicable implementation plan expressing its intention to adopt standards under the California clean fuel vehicle pilot test program; and (2) has adopted such standards no later than model year 1996.
