Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, but permits evidence to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. Sets forth: (1) mitigating and aggravating factors; and (2) special aggravating factors for espionage, treason, homicide, attempted murder of the President, and drug offenses punishable by the death penalty (including previous serious drug felony convictions, use of a firearm in committing or furthering certain continuing criminal enterprises, use of minors in trafficking, and lethal adulteration of controlled substances).

Title III: Exclusionary Rule - States that the Constitution does not require the exclusion from a criminal trial of evidence: (1) obtained in reasonable reliance on a search warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate who is not misled, even though the warrant is ultimately determined to be invalid; (2) the legal discovery of which was inevitable, even though the evidence was in fact discovered through constitutionally invalid means; or (3) for which a source exists that is independent of the source through which the evidence was in fact discovered through constitutionally invalid means. Title IV: Firearms - Subtitle A: Firearms and Related Amendments - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide for enhanced penalties for: (1) the use of a semiautomatic firearm during a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, with exceptions; and (2) possession of a firearm or explosive during the commission of such offenses.
