	6/21/1993--Passed House amended. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture: (1) to prepare an initial list of base lands that were relinquished to the United States pursuant to the Act of June 4, 1897, and for which selection or other rights under that Act or supplemental legislation were not realized or exercised; (2) identify those listed lands which are located within any conservation system unit and all other listed lands which the Congress has designated for specific management or which the Secretary concerned decides should be retained to meet public, resource protection, or administrative needs (nationally significant lands); and (3) publish a final list of base lands excluding such nationally significant lands. Vests in the United States title to those nationally significant lands for which title was not previously vested in the United States and provides for claims for compensation based on such vesting. Ouitclaims the interest of the United States to the lands on the final list and requires the Secretary concerned to issue documents of disclaimer of interest confirming the quitclaims. Authorizes appropriations.
