	<summary>
	11/19/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to provide that any agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the interest of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in any asset acquired in its capacity as conservator or receiver, and which does not meet certain statutory requirements, shall not form the basis of, or substantially comprise, a claim against the FDIC. (This narrows the applicability of the D'oench Duhane Doctrine only to agreements involving an asset.)
