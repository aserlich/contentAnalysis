(Sec.104) Requires AMTRAK to include in its annual operations report to the President and to the Congress projections of anticipated and realized benefits of proposed and previously funded projects. (Sec.105) Requires applications by a State, agency, or person for the institution of rail passenger service, or the retention of a route, train, or service which AMTRAK intends to discontinue, to include a statement that it agrees to pay in each year of service specified percentages of the long-term avoidable losses for each year (currently, short-term avoidable losses) of the operation of such service. Authorizes AMTRAK for each year of service to contribute specified percentages of such losses. Requires such a State, agency, or person, with respect to the renewal of such service, to state that it agrees to pay at least 65 percent of the long-term avoidable losses of operating such service and at least 50 percent of the associated capital costs. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to review and report to Congress on AMTRAK's State-assisted rail passenger services program. (Sec.106) Directs AMTRAK to make any capital improvements for the Northeast Corridor improvement project program necessary for reliable, high-speed rail passenger service and enhancement of capacity for intercity and commuter passenger service. Repeals the current authorization of appropriations for specific projects of the program, as well as the general authorization for deferment of certain Northeast Corridor improvement projects in order to carry out others. (Sec.107) Authorizes appropriations for: (1) AMTRAK operating expenses; (2) State requested rail passenger service; (3) capital investment; (4) construction expenses to convert the James A.

Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 110) Declares, for purposes of any State or local requirement for a permit or other approval for construction of any AMTRAK improvement under the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project, that the exemptions and procedures applicable to a Federal project shall apply. (Sec. 111) Directs AMTRAK to construct the electrification system between Boston, Massachusetts, and New Haven, Connecticut, to accommodate the installation of a third mainline track between Davisville and Central Falls, Rhode Island, to be used for double- stack freight service to and from the Port of Davisville. (Sec. 112) Establishes the Capital and Equipment Acquisition Account to: (1) acquire passenger equipment and locomotives; and (2) encourage State and local investment in facilities and equipment used to provide intercity rail passenger service. (Sec. 113) Requires the Secretary of Transportation, or the Secretary of the Treasury, to authorize the Delta Transportation Company, doing business as the Columbus and Greenville Railway, to redeem the obligations and liabilities of such company which remain outstanding. (Sec. 114) Revises the composition of the board of directors of AMTRAK to include one member specially qualified to represent the interests of rail passengers, who shall be selected from a list of three qualified individuals recommended by the National Association of Railroad Passengers. (Sec. 115) Directs AMTRAK to conduct a pilot program to explore feasible means of increasing non-Federal revenues through the sale of concessions on trains and the sale of advertising space on trains and in rail stations. (Sec. 116) Requires AMTRAK to cooperate with the Virginia State Department of Transportation in studying the feasibility of reestablishing rail service between Washington, D.C., and Bristol, Virginia. (Sec. 117) Directs AMTRAK, upon completion of the preliminary engineering and design for the rail connection between North Station and South Station in Boston, Massachusetts, to develop a plan for the construction of the Central Artery Rail Link to enable intercity and intracity passenger service between such points. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 118) Directs AMTRAK to form a task force to consider recommendations for improving emergency training and performance of on-board service and operating crew members. Requires the task force to report to specified congressional committees on actions implemented to date and recommended for the future.

(Sec. 202) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide disaster assistance for the repair of rail lines damaged as a result of a disaster.
