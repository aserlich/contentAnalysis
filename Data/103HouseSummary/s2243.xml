	<summary>
	7/1/1994--Passed Senate amended. Amends the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967 to direct the Secretary of State, until a specified date, to reimburse vessel owners for fees paid to a foreign government to engage in transit passage between points in the United States if such a fee is regarded by the United States as being inconsistent with international law. Authorizes use of unobligated balances of the Fishermen's Guaranty Fund and the Fishermen's Protective Fund and, if those are insufficient, authorizes appropriations. Repeals the statutory formula used to fix the related fees collected by the Secretary of State. Extends the Act's effective date from October 1, 1993, to October 1, 2000.
