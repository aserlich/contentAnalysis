	10/7/1994--Passed Senate amended. Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act Technical Amendments of 1993 - Makes technical amendments to the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. Specifies that members of the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention shall be appointed for a term of three years, with exceptions. Extends the time under which a White House conference on juvenile justice can be convened from 18 to 48 months after enactment of reauthorizing legislation. Revises the authorization level under the reauthorizing legislation to such sums as are necessary for FY 1994 through 1996. Amends the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 to provide funding for FY 1995 for programs for drug education and prevention relating to youth gangs and programs for runaway and homeless youth. Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to pay to Benchmark Rail Group, Inc., of St. Louis, Missouri, an amount equal to the total amount owed to such Group by FEMA and the State of California in compensation for the emergency work and services performed at the request of the Southern California Regional Rail Authority to the extent that such work and services are otherwise eligible for reimbursement under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster and Emergency Assistance Act. Directs that the payment be made from funds appropriated to implement such Act. Requires FEMA to deobligate an equal amount to that previously obligated for payment to such State to cover the costs of work performed for the Authority by such Group after the Northridge earthquake which would have been eligible for reimbursement under such Act.
