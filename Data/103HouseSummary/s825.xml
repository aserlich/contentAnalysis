	<summary>
	9/28/1994--Reported to Senate amended. Amends the Federal judicial code to make an exception to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state in any case in which money damages are sought for personal injury or death of a U.S. citizen caused by the torture or extrajudicial killing of that citizen, or by an act of aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or genocide committed against that citizen by such state or any agent of such state acting within the scope of office, employment, or agency. Specifies that: (1) such an action shall not be maintained unless the individual was a U.S. citizen at the time the conduct causing such injury or death occurred and unless the action is brought within ten years, or where the cause of action is based on an act of genocide occurring more than ten years before this Act's enactment date, within 18 months after such date; and (2) the court shall decline to hear a claim under this Act if the claimant has not exhausted adequate and available remedies in the place in which the conduct giving rise to the claim occurred and has not afforded the foreign state an opportunity to arbitrate the claim before an international tribunal in accordance with international standards. Makes an exception to the immunity of the property of a foreign state used in the United States for commercial activity from attachment or execution if a judgment entered by a court of the United States or of a State relates to a claim for which, by virtue of this Act, the foreign state, agency, or instrumentality is not immune, regardless of whether the property is or was involved in the act upon which the claim is based.
