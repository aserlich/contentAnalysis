Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the release of personal information about any individual obtained by a State department of motor vehicles (DMV) in connection with a motor vehicle operator's permit, title, identification card, or registration, unless such individual has authorized such disclosure. Makes exceptions for specified routine uses if the person receiving the information has certified that the information will be used only for one of the specified permissible purposes, including use: (1) by any Federal, State, or local court or agency in carrying out its functions; (2) in connection with matters of automobile and driver safety, in any civil or criminal proceeding involving a motor vehicle, and in research or marketing activities; and (3) by any insurer in connection with claims investigation and antifraud activities. Prohibits (with exceptions): (1) a State motor vehicle department, organization, or person from disclosing, selling, or otherwise making available or using such personal information, except in accordance with this Act; and (2) any person or organization from making any false representation to obtain personal information about any such individual from a State DMV or other person or using personal information obtained from State DMV or other person for any purpose other than as requested by that person or organization, or other than the purpose for which such information was disclosed. Sets penalties for willful and nonwillful violations by individuals, organizations, and DMVs.
