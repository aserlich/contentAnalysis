	8/2/1994--Indefinitely postponed in Senate. TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 Title II: Amendments to the General Education Provisions Act Title III: Amendments to Other Acts Title IV: Miscellaneous Title V: Workers Technology Skill Development Title VI: Multiethnic Placement Title VII: Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Act Title VIII: 1994 Institutions Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 - Title I: Amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to revise and reauthorize ESEA. (Sec. 101) Establishes a title I program for Helping Children in Need Meet High Standards, which revises and reauthorizes some of the current title I chapter 1 programs of Financial Assistance to Meet the Special Educational Needs of Children. Declares it to be U.S. policy to expand the title I program over FY 1995 through 1999 by increasing funding by a specified minimum amount each fiscal year and increasing the number of eligible children served with the intent of serving them all by FY 2004. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) grants under the basic program; (2) Even Start; (3) education of migratory children; (4) education for neglected or delinquent youth; (5) capital expenses; and (6) Federal activities. Requires any State desiring to receive a grant (under the basic program for making high-poverty schools work) to submit State plans that are integrated with that State's plan under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act or with other State plans under this Act. Requires each State plan to describe high-quality standards for all children that will be used by the State, its local educational agencies (LEAs), and its schools to carry out this Act, including high-quality academic content standards and student performance standards, as well as assessment provisions and other teaching and learning support provisions. Directs the Secretary of Education to establish a process for peer review and Secretarial approval. Requires LEAs receiving subgrants to have plans with assessments and other provisions. Provides for State approval and shared program responsibility of schools and the LEA in deciding on schoolwide programs and targeted assistance schools. Allows an LEA to only use basic program funds in eligible school attendance areas in which the percentage of children from low-income families is at least as high as that: (1) from low-income families served by the LEA as a whole; or (2) served by the LEA as a whole who are eligible to participate in a schoolwide program. Sets forth formulas for ranking eligible school attendance areas for purposes of such funding in various cases where there are insufficient funds. Sets forth criteria which a school must meet in order for the LEA to use basic program funds to upgrade the entire educational program at an eligible school (schoolwide programs). Provides that in participating schools that are ineligible for a schoolwide program or that choose not to operate a schoolwide program, an LEA may use basic program funds only for targeted assistance programs that provide services to eligible economically disadvantaged children identified as having the greatest need for special assistance (targeted assistance schools). Sets forth criteria for eligible children at such schools. Sets forth requirements for parental involvement and for participation of children enrolled in private schools. Provides for assessment and LEA and school improvement, including local review, school improvement identification, and State review and LEA improvement. Requires each State educational agency (SEA) to establish a statewide system of support and improvement for schools receiving title I funds. Includes under such system school support teams, designation of Distinguished Schools, State establishment of a corps of Distinguished Educators, State allocations for school improvement and alternative or additional approaches. Revises formulas for allocations of funds. Transitions to Success Act of 1994 - Directs the Secretary to reserve a portion of basic grant funds for Transition to Success Challenge Grants allocations to States. Requires States to submit transition coordinated services proposals. Requires SEAs to make such challenge grants to LEAs that have formed consortia with early childhood development programs (including Head Start) for programs that assist low-income elementary school children in kindergarten through third grade and their families in obtaining supportive services and supporting active involvement of parents in their children's education. Provides for consultation and coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Revises Even Start Family Literacy Programs to increase program services and high-poverty-area targeting and include teenage parents. Revises Education of Migratory Children to restrict eligibility to children who have moved within the previous four years. Revises Education of Neglected and Delinquent Youth to base part of the formula for subgrants to State agencies on the number of neglected or delinquent children who are enrolled for at least: (1) 15 hours per week in education programs in adult correctional institutions; or (2) 20 hours per week in education programs in institutions for such children or in community day programs for such children. Sets forth provisions for Federal evaluations and demonstrations and general provisions, including reservation of funds for territories. Establishes an Educational Opportunity Demonstration Program, under which the Secretary may grant waivers to ten LEAs for the design and operation of one or more educational opportunity schools. Requires that any such public elementary, middle, or high school or consortium receiving such waiver: (1) establish a plan for voluntary, same gender classes at one or more schools in the community; (2) provide same gender classes for both boys and girls, as well as a coeducational option for parents; (3) use a lottery for admission if more students apply than can be accommodated; (4) have a program for volunteer community members in same gender classes; and (5) pursue a specific set of educational objectives determined by the LEA in conjunction with an educational opportunity advisory board. Requires a study and report on such program, comparing educational and behavioral achievement of those choosing same gender classes and those choosing the coeducational option. Eliminates title I provisions for the National Commission on Migrant Education, rural technical assistance centers, current chapter 2 State block grants under the partnership for educational improvement, national diffusion network, and law-related education. Eliminates under title I, but provides elsewhere for, evaluation and technical assistance and blue ribbon schools. Provides, later in this Act, for programs for handicapped children to be combined with programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Establishes a new ESEA title II, Improving Teaching and Learning, with a new part A, Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program, to support professional development of elementary and secondary school teachers in core academic subjects. (This replaces the current Dwight D. Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education Act programs.) Gives priority for professional development in mathematics and science. Authorizes appropriations. Provides for Federal program activities in general, as well as for a mathematics and science education clearinghouse and a national teacher training project. Authorizes the Secretary to award a grant or contract to establish an Eisenhower National Clearinghouse for Mathematics and Science Education. National Teacher Training Project Act of 1994 - Authorizes the Secretary to award up to ten grants to ten different eligible recipients for half of the costs of supporting: (1) teacher training programs in early childhood development and one of nine specified core academic subjects; and (2) classroom research on effective teaching practices. Provides for State and local activities, with priority for professional development in mathematics and science. Directs the Secretary to award demonstration grants to eligible partnerships for planning and implementing professional development programs. National Writing Project Act - Establishes a new ESEA title II part B, the National Writing Project (provisions for such project under title II of the Educational Council Act of 1991 are repealed later in this Act). Provides for coordination of such project activities with other teacher training and professional development activities. Authorizes appropriations for the National Writing Project.
