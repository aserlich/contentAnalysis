(Sec. 104) Vests Fund management in an Administrator. Directs the Administrator to establish the Community Development Advisory Board (the Board) to advise on Fund policies, but not on the granting or denial of any particular application. Cites circumstances under which an applicant may be considered an agency or instrumentality of a State government even though there is no existing community development financial institution in operation on the date of enactment of this Act. Prescribes selection criteria for community partnerships and institutions. Mandates Fund assistance for geographically diverse groups of applicants from urban, rural, and Native American communities. Makes exceptions to the non-Federal matching funds requirements in the case of an applicant with severe constraints on available sources of matching funds. Provides for a Fund training program to assist the financial services industry to undertake community development activities. (Sec. 111) Authorizes the Fund to establish an information clearinghouse. Instructs the Fund to require community development financial institutions receiving assistance to compile and maintain specified user profile data. Requires the Fund to study and report to the President and the Congress on lending and investment practices on Indian reservations and other lands held in Federal trust. Authorizes the Fund to provide capitalization assistance to enhance the liquidity of community development financial institutions. (Sec. 116) Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to authorize the National Credit Union Administration Board (NCUAB) to invest idle moneys from the Community Development Credit Union Revolving Loan Fund into Treasury securities, and to use the interest earned for technical assistance to community development credit unions. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1994 through 1997. Subtitle B: Home Ownership and Equity Protection - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to set forth disclosure requirements for high cost mortgages which meet specified criteria with respect to the annual percentage rate and points and fees which exceed certain limits. Defines a high cost mortgage as a consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, other than a residential mortgage transaction, a reverse mortgage transaction, or a transaction under an open end credit plan. (Sec. 151) Prohibits the terms of such mortgages from requiring: (1) prepayment penalties; (2) certain refinancing charges payable to the same creditor; (3) balloon payments; (4) negative amortization; and (5) certain consolidated prepaid payments. (Sec. 152) Imposes a civil penalty for violations of this Act. (Sec. 153) Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require a creditor to disclose conspicuously to a consumer specified lending data on reverse mortgage transactions. Title II: Small Business Capital Formation - Subtitle A: Small Business Loan Securitization - Small Business Loan Securitization and Secondary Market Enhancement Act of 1994 - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to define a &quot;small business related security&quot; (SBRS) as generally a high rated security that represents or is secured by an interest in promissory notes or leases of personal property evidencing the obligation of a small business concern. Applies to SBRS subject to Federal Reserve Board terms and conditions specified exemptions from margin requirements and credit prohibitions currently applicable to mortgage related securities. (Sec. 206) Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act, the Federal Credit Union Act, and related statutes to allow banks, credit unions, and other depository institutions to invest in SBRSs.

Provides for enactment by States of specific requirements for SBRSs, overriding the preemptions of this title. (Sec. 208) Requires the accounting principles applicable to the transfer of a small business loan or lease of personal property with recourse contained in reports or statements required by appropriate Federal banking agencies to be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. Requires the amount of capital required to be maintained by a depository institution with respect to the sale of a small business loan with recourse to equal an amount sufficient to meet the institution's reasonable estimated liability under the recourse arrangement. Sets forth capital and reserve requirements for the transfer by qualified insured depository institutions of small business loans with recourse. (Sec. 209) Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to exempt transactions involving SBRSs from certain restrictions and taxes imposed on &quot;prohibited transactions&quot; under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code (thereby allowing pension fund managers to participate in the pooling and packaging of small business loans for sale as securities). (Sec. 210) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the taxation of a small business loan investment conduit and the holder of an interest therein should be similar to the taxation of a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC) and the holder of an interest therein under the Internal Revenue Code.

Authorizes any State to apply to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for approval as a participating State eligible for reimbursement. Sets forth application approval criteria.

Specifies that: (1) if a State is approved, each financial institution with a particular agreement in effect with the State shall immediately be considered a participating financial institution; and (2) a State with an existing program that is approved may continue to implement the program utilizing the reserve funds accumulated under the State program. (Sec. 254) Establishes requirements for participation agreements. (Sec. 257) Provides for reimbursement by the Secretary of participating States, based on specified formulas. Requires a participating State that withdraws funds from a reserve fund pursuant to terms of the participation agreement to reimburse the Secretary according to a specified formula. (Sec. 260) Authorizes appropriations.

(Sec. 317) Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to permit agreements made by a Federal, State, or local governmental entity for the collateralization of deposits even though the agreement was not executed contemporaneously with the acquisition of the collateral or with any changes in the collateral made in accordance with such an agreement. (Sec. 318) Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to repeal the requirement that the Federal banking regulatory agencies prescribe specified standards for all insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with respect to asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation. (Sec. 319) Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to set forth expedited procedures for forming a bank holding company. (Sec. 320) Amends the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt certain holding company formations from its registration requirements.

(Sec. 323) Amends Federal banking law and the Home Owners' Loan Act to authorize national banks and Federal savings associations to purchase shares in a bankers' bank in cases where some of the other investors are depository institution holding companies. (Sec. 325) Amends the FDIA to: (1) require the Attorney General to notify banking regulatory agencies of proposed mergers raising significant competitiveness issues; and (2) allow the FDIC to waive in advance the right to subsequently repudiate an insured depository institution's sale of its credit card accounts receivable. (Sec. 327) Amends the Federal Reserve Act and the FDIA to limit the liability of member banks for deposits made at foreign branches in specified cases of political upheaval. (Sec. 329) Amends the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) to cite circumstances under which the mandatory disclosures of the Truth in Lending Act may be substituted for those required under RESPA. (Sec. 330) Requires reports to the Congress on: (1) the impact of risk-capital standards upon the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions and the availability of credit; (2) the monetary and budgetary impacts of the payment of interest upon certain sterile reserves held by insured depository institutions; and (3) streamlined home mortgage, small business, and consumer lending procedures.

(Sec. 339) Amends the Federal Reserve Act to authorize the Board to suspend the applicability of the Act's insider lending structures if it finds that an individual does not actually participate in major policy making functions of the member bank.

(Sec. 347) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to modify the definition of mortgage related security to include a promissory note directly secured by a first lien on a parcel of real estate upon which is located one or more commercial structures.
