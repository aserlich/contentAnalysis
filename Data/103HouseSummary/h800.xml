	<summary>
	2/3/1993--Introduced.
Deems a veteran with a service-connected disability to be a socially and economically disadvantaged individual, thus permitting such individual to be included in a target group of minorities for which the Department of Defense seeks to obligate five percent of all DOD procurement contracts during FY 1992 and 1993. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 to include small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities as businesses eligible for the minority contract goal for defense procurement contract awards.
