Veteran Women's Health Improvement Act of 1993 - Includes women's health services within the definition of medical services authorized to be furnished to eligible veterans. Includes as women's health services pap smears, breast examinations, and reproductive health care. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans to contract with non-Department of Veterans facilities for outpatient women's health services when Department facilities are inadequate or inaccessible. Requires information on the provision of women's health services to be included in a report from the Secretary to the Congress concerning women veterans. Amends the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 to: (1) require consultation by the Secretary with various officials, advisory committees, and task forces with regard to appropriate women's health research; (2) expand the research related to women to include specified topics; (3) include certain appropriate personnel of the Department in conducting such research, including women veterans and veteran members of minority groups; and (4) direct that a women veterans population study report required under such Act include an examination of the medical and demographic histories of women veterans comprising the study sample. Makes applicable to Department medical facilities provisions of the Public Health Service Act regarding mammography quality standards. Requires all Department facilities to meet such standards within two years.
