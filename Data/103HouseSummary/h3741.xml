Collision Damage Waiver Act - Prohibits rental car companies, in rental agreements of 30 continuous days or less, from holding any authorized driver liable for any damage, except in any case in which: (1) the damage is caused intentionally by an authorized driver or as a result of such driver's willful and wanton misconduct, operation of the vehicle while legally intoxicated or under the influence of an illegal drug, while engaged in a criminal act, or in the course of any speed contest; (2) the rental transaction is based on information the renter supplied with intent to defraud the rental car company; (3) damage arises out of the use of the vehicle to carry individuals or property for hire; or (4) the damage arises out of the use of the vehicle outside the United States or Canada (unless specifically authorized by the rental agreement). Prohibits waiver of these exceptions. Prohibits a rental car company, during the rental period or pending resolution of any dispute, from requiring or requesting a damage security deposit in any form. Sets forth civil penalties for violation of this Act.
