	5/19/1994--Reported to House amended, Part II. Department of Energy Laboratory Technology Act of 1994 - Authorizes the Department of Energy (DOE) departmental laboratories to pursue specified missions including: (1) maintaining national security relating to nuclear weapons; (2) ensuring the national energy supply with respect to reduced reliance upon imported and nonrenewable energy sources; (3) conducting basic research in energy-related science and technology in the fundamental understanding of matter; and (4) minimizing the environmental impacts of the use and production of energy and materials. Restricts DOE authority to pursue additional missions at departmental laboratories to those with non-conflicting missions established by statute before enactment of this Act, or those: (1) assigned by the President; (2) that do not interfere with the statutory missions; and (3) for which the laboratories possess substantial technical capabilities. Prohibits the set-aside for technology transfer initiatives of more than 20 percent of the funds earmarked for weapons activities research and development. Instructs the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) to: (1) implement an evaluation scheme for departmental laboratory missions and technology transfer projects; and (2) report to the Congress on future uses of such laboratories, and alternatives to current mission assignments, budgets, and management structures, as well as preservation of the core intellectual and technical competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons and options for reducing the cost of DOE nuclear weapons research, development, engineering, and test-related programs. Requires the Secretary and the directors of each departmental laboratory to seek advice from U.S. industry, educational institutions, and professional and technical societies. Authorizes the Secretary to establish new or use existing advisory bodies. Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to expedite the implementation process for cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs), and to reduce from 90 to 30 days the time required for review and or/approval of CRADAs governing federally-owned, non-Federal contractor-operated laboratories. Mandates that any CRADA involving a Federal commitment of $500,000 or more contain technical milestones, goals, and criteria annually reviewed by the sponsoring Federal agency. Authorizes a Federal agency to permit the director of its Government-owned, contractor-operated laboratories to enter into a CRADA agreement without its specific approval if it involves a Federal commitment of $500,000 or less. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a National Technology Partnership Award. Directs the President to submit to the Congress an implementation plan to evaluate and coordinate the missions, activities, and resources of the Federal laboratories. Proscribes any authorization of funds to the Secretary for substantial capital projects and construction unless: (1) the Secretary submits prescribed reports to the Congress; and (2) there is prior authorization by statute. Mandates an objective merit review process as a prerequisite to any financial assistance awarded to any person for nonmilitary research, development, or precommercial demonstration activities (including related facility construction).
