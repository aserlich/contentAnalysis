Expands the list of system requirements to include requirements that a system: (1) have access to any resident who has a developmental disability in a facility that is providing assistance to such resident; (2) hire and maintain sufficient numbers and types of staff to carry out the system's functions, except that such State shall not apply hiring freezes, reductions in force, prohibitions on staff travel, or other policies, to the extent that such policies would impact staff or functions funded with Federal funds and would prevent the system from carrying out its functions under this Act; and (3) have the authority to educate policymakers. Revises allotment formulas.
