Senate Floor Procedures Reform Resolution of 1994 - Amends rule XV of the Standing Rules of the Senate to require, on a point of order made by any Senator, the signature of at least ten Senators before amendments expressing the sense of the Senate or the sense of the Congress, or an amendment thereto, can be received. Amends rule XXVIII to provide that notwithstanding a request for the reading of a conference report (if it is printed and available one day prior to a motion to consider it) the vote on such motion shall be immediately put and shall be determined without debate. Amends rule VIII to provide for a two-hour debate, divided between the majority and minority leaders, on motions to proceed to the consideration of bills and resolutions made by the majority leader after the first two hours of a new legislative day. Makes such motions to proceed by the majority leader or any other Senator to motions, resolutions, or amendments to change any of the Standing Rules of the Senate debatable. Amends rule XXII to require an affirmative three-fifths vote for post-cloture appeals from the decision of the Presiding Officer, except on a measure or motion to amend the Senate rules where a necessary affirmative vote shall be two-thirds of the Senators present and voting. Amends rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate relating to amendments to appropriation bills in the Senate to: (1) prohibit the Senate, on a point of order, from receiving any amendment not germane or relevant to the subject matter contained in the bill as passed by the House or as reported by the Senate; (2) require all questions of relevancy or germaneness of amendments to be ruled on by the chair; and (3) require an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Senators to overturn a ruling of the chair regarding questions of germaneness, relevancy, or legislation in such amendments or to waive such provisions of the rule with respect to an amendment.
