3/24/1994--Introduced.
National Park Scenic Overflight Concessions Act of 1994 - Amends the National Park Service Concessions Policy Act to prohibit a person from flying an individual for compensation over a National Park System (NPS) unit to view any portion of the unit unless the person has in effect a valid commercial air tour permit issued by the Secretary of the Interior. Requires the Secretary to publish guidelines applicable to commercial air tour flights over NPS units providing for such flights where appropriate and restricting or prohibiting such flights where necessary. Authorizes the Secretary to amend the general management plan for any NPS unit to establish air concessions requirements applicable to flights subject to the permit requirements of this Act that: (1) document the degree to which commercial scenic overflights may affect the natural resources of the park unit concerned and the effects of such overflights on the park visitor's experience; and (2) propose measures necessary to protect park resources and the visitor's experience from the adverse effects of commercial scenic overflights. Imposes a fine and up to five years' imprisonment on any person who knowingly or willfully violates any requirement, rule, or regulation promulgated pursuant to this Act. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in cooperation with the Secretary, to develop: (1) standardized reporting systems for the documentation of low flying aircraft incidents in airspace over NPS units; and (2) training programs and instructional materials for National Park Service personnel to enable them to recognize and report such incidents. Requires the Administrator to amend the FAA regulations to treat aircraft noise abatement at NPS units as in the public interest. Directs the Administrator and the Secretary to report jointly to the Congress on the progress made under this Act and other authority of law in mitigating the adverse effects of commercial scenic overflights at NPS units.
