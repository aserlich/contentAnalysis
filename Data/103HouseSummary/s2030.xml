Describes such income as the least of: (1) income from the active conduct of a trade or business in which the taxpayer is a material participant; (2) net earnings from self-employment; or (3) the taxpayer's share of additions to a qualified retained earnings account of such trade or business. Allows distributions from such account to pay ordinary and necessary business expenses or to pay the tax imposed by this Act. Excludes from employment taxes the portion of taxable small business income in excess of $135,000.
