	<summary>
	11/5/1993--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President and Secretary of State should: (1) raise the matter of Hugo Princz (a U.S. citizen who was liberated by U.S. armed forces at the close of World War II and whose application for reparations from the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) as a &quot;survivor&quot; was rejected) with the FRG, including the Chancellor and Foreign Minister, and ensure that this matter will be expeditiously resolved and that fair reparations will be provided to Princz; and (2) state that the United States will not countenance the continued discriminatory treatment of Princz.
