	11/22/1993--Introduced.
Bias Crimes Compensation Act of 1993 - States that all U.S. individuals shall have the right to be free from bias-motivated crimes of violence (crimes arising from differences in race, color, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or physical or mental disability). Creates a Federal civil rights claim against anyone who deprives an individual of such right, with compensatory and punitive damages, and injunctive or declaratory relief. Provides limitations, procedures, and rules of construction, including the limitation that random acts of violence, as opposed to bias-motivated acts, shall not be a basis for such a claim.
