	3/16/1994--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President: (1) should not have extended diplomatic recognition to the Skopje regime that insists on using the Greek name of Macedonia; and (2) should reconsider this decision and withdraw recognition and any consideration of financial assistance until such time as that regime renounces its use of the name Macedonia, removes objectionable language in the preamble and specified paragraphs of its constitution, removes symbols which imply territorial expansion such as the Star of Vergina in its flag, ceases propaganda against Greece, and adheres fully to Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe norms and principles.
