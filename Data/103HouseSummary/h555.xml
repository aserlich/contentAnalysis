	1/21/1993--Introduced.
Amends: (1) the Consumer Credit Protection Act to require a consumer reporting agency (CRA) to include in any consumer report information provided by a State child support agency or verified by another government entity on the failure of the consumer to pay overdue child support; and (2) the Social Security Act (SSA) to require States to provide CRAs with information on overdue child support obligations of absent parents. Eliminates: (1) the requirement under the SSA that such information be made upon the request of the CRA; and (2) the authority of the State under the SSA to impose a fee upon the requesting CRA for the furnishing of such information.
