	11/19/1993--Introduced.
Requires annual budget requests submitted by the Secretary of the Interior to include information as to whether the Bureau of Land Management, through preparation of land-use plans pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, has identified public lands which are suitable for transfer to other management or for disposal which transfer or disposal has been delayed because of incomplete surveys or other reasons. Authorizes the Secretary to include a proposal for additional legislation in such request to facilitate such transfer or disposal.
