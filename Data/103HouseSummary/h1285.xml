Public Buildings Act Amendments of 1993 - Amends the Public Buildings Act of 1959 to prohibit the Committees on Public Works of the Senate and House of Representatives from adopting a resolution of approval for construction, alteration, purchase, or acquisition of a building before the Administrator of General Services submits a prospectus of the proposed facility. Includes within the list of prospectus requirements a statement that the vacancy rate (within 30 miles of the proposed facility) for commercial office space comparable to that provided by the facility is greater than ten percent unless the Administrator certifies that material and substantial savings will accrue to U.S. taxpayers from the facility.
