	<summary>
	10/4/1994--Passed House amended. Condemns the Cuban Government for deliberately sinking the &quot;13th of March,&quot; a tugboat carrying 72 unarmed Cuban citizens, on July 18, 1994, causing the death of approximately 40 Cuban citizens, including over 20 children. Urges the President to direct the U.S. Representative to the United Nations (UN) to urge: (1) the Security Council to adopt a resolution that condemns the sinking and provides for a full internationally supervised investigation; and (2) the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate such sinking. Urges the Cuban Government to release from prison and cease intimidation measures against all survivors, identify all individuals missing, recover the bodies of the dead, and return such bodies to their families.
