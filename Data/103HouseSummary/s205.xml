	1/26/1993--Introduced.
National Triad Program Act - Requires the Director of the National Institute of Justice to conduct a national assessment of: (1) crimes against the elderly; (2) the needs of law enforcement, health, and social service organizations in working to assist victims; and (3) promising strategies to respond effectively. Specifies that such assessment shall address the problems of elderly who are living alone or in high crime areas and who are abused and neglected and the fear of victimization. Authorizes the Director to make awards to: (1) coalitions of local law enforcement agencies, victim service providers, and organizations representing the elderly for pilot programs and field tests of promising strategies and models for forging partnerships for crime prevention and service provision. Specifies that pilot programs may include existing general service coalitions of law enforcement, victim service, and elder advocate organizations that wish to use additional funds to work at a particular problem in their community or to target a particular geographic area; (2) research organizations to investigate the types of elder victimization that present particularly critical problems or emerging crimes about which little is known, to evaluate the effectiveness of selected pilot programs, and to conduct critical research and development; and (3) public service advertising coalitions to increase public awareness of, and promote ideas or programs to prevent, crimes against the elderly. Authorizes appropriations.
