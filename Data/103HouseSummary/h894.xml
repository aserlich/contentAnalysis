Mandate Relief Act of 1993 - Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to estimate and submit to the Congress the cost which will be incurred by State and local governments in complying with legislation reported by a congressional committee or conference committee and a comparison of such estimate with any available estimate made by such committee or a Federal agency. Amends the Rules of the House of Representative to: (1) require such CBO estimate and comparison to be included in committee reports on the legislation; and (2) make it out of order to consider legislation for which a CBO estimate is required unless the legislation contains a statement that any provisions thereof requiring a State or local government to conduct an activity shall not apply unless the Federal Government has provided amounts to cover the direct costs of such activity to such government.
