	4/29/1993--Introduced.
Withdraws all federally-owned lands within the Badger-Two Medicine Area in Montana from all forms of entry, appropriation, and disposal under the mining and public land laws and from disposal under geothermal and mineral leasing laws. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to manage the Area to protect its currently existing wilderness qualities. Allows the Blackfeet Tribe to gather timber within the Area in exercise of valid treaty rights. Prohibits any surface disturbance from being permitted with respect to oil and gas leases on Federal lands within the Area until Congress determines otherwise. Extends the term of any oil and gas lease, subject to the limitations imposed by this Act, for a period of time equal to the terms that such limitation remains in effect. Requires the Secretary to review this Area in accordance with the Wilderness Act of 1964 and report to the Congress and to give special consideration to the religious, wilderness, and wildlife uses of the Area taking into account any U.S. treaties entered into with the Blackfeet Nation. Requires the Secretary to establish a process to provide information to the Tribe and interested public about options for future designation of the Area.
