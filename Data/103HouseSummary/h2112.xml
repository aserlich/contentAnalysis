	8/4/1993--Reported to House amended, Part I. National Environmental Trade Development Act of 1993 - Declares it is the policy of the United States: (1) to maintain its role as a leader in exporting environmental technology (including marine biotechnology), goods, and services to the global market for the benefit of the global environment; and (2) to increase economic growth and private sector jobs in the environmental technology field, including marine biotechnology. Directs the President, through the Office of Environmental Policy and the National Economic Council, to coordinate Federal export promotion programs so they are consistent with the national strategy to increase environmental exports. Requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to review the applicable programs of the Department of Commerce, including the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service and other components of the International Trade Administration, as well as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to ensure that such programs are consistent with the national strategy to increase environmental exports. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress regarding any Federal programs found to be inconsistent with the national strategy. Directs the Secretary to establish at the Department of Commerce and the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service one-stop shops to provide to U.S. businesses selling environmental technology (including marine biotechnology), goods, and services, information on technical and financial assistance programs, potential global market opportunities, including trade fairs, for those businesses, and on international environmental regulations. Directs the President to establish an Environmental Trade Promotion Council to develop the national strategy to increase U.S. exports of environmental technology (including marine biotechnology), goods, and services. Provides for the designation of Regional Environmental Business and Technology Cooperation Centers to supply assistance, education, and training for U.S. and foreign companies that provide and acquire such items. Provides for matching grants to up to six Centers for specified purposes (excluding construction of new facilities). Requires each grant-receiving Center to recover its service and technical assistance provision costs by charging fees. Establishes within the Peace Corps the Senior Environmental Service Corps which shall provide volunteers with experience in environmental management, environmental technology (including marine biotechnology), sustainable development, coastal zone management, or marine pollution and prevention to countries requesting such help. Authorizes the Secretary to establish American Business Centers, including Environmental Business Centers, in countries that offer new market possibilities for the export of U.S. environmental technology (including marine biotechnology), goods, and services. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1994 through 1998.
