	1/6/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to prohibit any person from acquiring 15 percent or more of the voting securities of a major air carrier or person who controls a major air carrier, unless such person complies with specified notification and waiting period requirements under the Act and the Secretary of Transportation has not disapproved the acquisition. Makes the same requirement for any person with less than 15 percent ownership if the acquisition would increase ownership to 15 percent or more. Requires the Secretary to disapprove an acquisition if specified findings are made.
