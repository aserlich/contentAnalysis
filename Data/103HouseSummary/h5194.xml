	10/5/1994--Introduced.
Women's Progress Assessment Act - Amends Federal census law to require the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to collect, compile, and publish statistics concerning the status of women and girls of all ages in the United States, in foreign countries, and in refugee camps, including statistics in the following priority areas: (1) participation in the labor force and educational and political institutions; (2) the structure of, care of, and support for families; and (3) fertility regulation behavior and health. Requires the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, acting through its regional bureaus as well as its offices of population and women in development, and the Secretary of State, acting through the Bureau for Refugee Programs, to collect the information concerning the foreign countries and refugee camps. Requires the Secretary, the Secretary of State, and the Administrator to seek to develop and establish internationally comparable measures and standard methodologies for collection of information on women and their roles in both a large scale quantitative manner and in-depth descriptive manner based on smaller samples, surveys, or case studies. Requires the U.S. Agency for International Development, the State Department, and the Bureau of the Census to incorporate these measures and methodologies into their current and future data collection effort. Requires the Bureau of the Census to promote these measures and methodologies in international programs. Requires the Secretary to publish the collected statistics, together with information obtained from other Federal entities: (1) for the United States, in 1997 and every second year thereafter; and (2) for foreign countries, in 1999 and every fifth year thereafter. Requires: (1) the Secretary to establish a Federal Forum on Women's Statistics; and (2) the Forum to meet semiannually to exchange information on current collection and survey initiatives and to avoid duplication of efforts, to identify gaps in data, and to carry out other activities as the Secretary shall designate.
