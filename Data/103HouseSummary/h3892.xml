Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require State procedures to ensure that a copy of each child support order issued or modified in the State is transmitted to the national registry. Requires the national registry, upon the receipt from an employer of a W-4 form completed by an employee, to: (1) compare information on the form with its information on the child support obligations of the employee; and (2) report to the employer information on whether the employee is subject to a child support order and, if so, the amount of monthly support involved, as well as the individual to whom such support is owed. Title II: Enforcement of Child Support Orders Through Employer Withholding - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to require all: (1) employees to file with their employers new W-4 forms including information on child support obligations and health insurance coverage for dependent children; and (2) employers to provide a copy of each such form to the national registry. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require employers to: (1) deduct and withhold child support obligations from employee wages; (2) pay such obligations to the person entitled to them; and (3) include withheld obligations on the employee's W-2 form. Title III: Enforcement of Criminal Penalties for Flight to Avoid Payment of Child Support - Authorizes appropriations to the Attorney General for the enforcement of criminal penalties for flight to avoid payment of child support. Title IV: Credit Bureau Reporting - Revises SSA title IV part D provisions for State child support enforcement procedures concerned with providing information on overdue support to consumer reporting agencies. Title V: National Jurisdiction - Amends the Federal judicial code to require the appropriate authorities of every State to enforce according to its terms a child support order made by a court of another state, provided that the court has personal jurisdiction of the contestants. Specifies the conditions under which a court: (1) has personal jurisdiction over nonresident contestants; (2) may modify an order for the same child made by a court of another State; and (3) may exercise jurisdiction in any proceeding for an order commenced during the pendency of a proceeding in a court of another State. Requires that reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard be given to the contestants before an order is made. Amends SSA title IV part D to require State procedures for child support enforcement to include procedures under which States may assert personal jurisdiction over nonresident contestants for purpose of adjudicating parenting and/or establishing child support orders under certain conditions. Declares that the Congress finds that due process is satisfied when a child's State of domicile asserts personal jurisdiction (long arm jurisdiction) over a nonresident contestant who is the parent or presumed parent of that child in an action to adjudicate parent or establish a child support order. Outlines the duration of parental obligations to provide child support, including extensions thereof to cover disabilities and college enrollment, for children born to a marriage or out-of-wedlock whose parentage has been determined under law. Title VI: Administrative Process - Revises SSA title IV part D provisions for expedited process procedures for obtaining and enforcing support orders to require procedures for obtaining expedited administrative process are used to establish paternity in contested paternity cases and to establish and enforce support orders in all cases. Title VII: Medical Child Support Orders Issued by Administrative Adjudicators - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to include medical child support orders issued by an administrative adjudicator within the definition of medical child support order under that Act. Title VIII: Elimination of Operating Subsidies for Vacant Public Housing - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to eliminate: (1) operating subsidies for vacant public housing units; and (2) the annual contribution reserve. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to recapture any amounts reserved from annual contributions for public housing agencies and deposited in accounts established on behalf of the agencies.
