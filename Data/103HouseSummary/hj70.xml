Constitutional Amendment - Provides for a four-year term of office for Members of the House of Representatives. Limits Representatives to three consecutive four-year terms and Senators to two consecutive six-year terms. Makes exceptions for special elections to fill vacancies for less than a full term. Requires such Representative or Senator (after a consecutive 12-year term) to be absent for at least one term before he or she can be elected to that seat again. Prohibits a Representative or Senator from serving more than six or four consecutive terms, respectively.
