	10/4/1994--Passed House amended. TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Minor Crop Protection Title II: Public Health Pesticides Title III: Antimicrobial Pesticides Title IV: Expedited Review of Certain Pesticide Registrations Minor Crop Protection Act of 1994 - Title I: Minor Crop Protection - Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to define &quot;minor use&quot; as the use of a pesticide on an animal or a commercial agricultural crop or site or for the protection of public health where: (1) the use does not provide sufficient economic incentive to support registration; and (2) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not determined that the use presents an unreasonable adverse environmental effect. (Sec. 101) Extends the period of exclusive data use for data submitted to support original registration applications for pesticides for an additional three years if the Administrator approves at least three minor uses of the pesticide before the expiration of the period of exclusive use. Requires the Administrator, upon the request of a registrant, to extend the deadline for the production of residue chemistry data required solely to support a minor use pesticide subject to specified conditions. Applies the same extension conditions to data for reregistrations. Permits the Administrator, in handling the registration of a pesticide for a minor use, to waive applicable data requirements if such use does not have an adverse environmental effect. Provides for expedited review (within six months of submission) of applications to support minor use pesticide registrations. Directs EPA to assure coordination of minor use issues through the establishment of a minor use program. Establishes and authorizes funding for a Department of Agriculture minor use matching fund program. Requires the program to be utilized to ensure the continued availability of minor use crop protection chemicals. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Public Health Pesticides - Directs the Administrator to consider the risks and benefits of public health pesticides separately from the risks and benefits of other pesticides. Requires the Administrator, in weighing any regulatory action concerning a public health pesticide, to weigh any risks of the pesticide against the health risks to be controlled by the pesticide. (Sec. 201) Defines: (1) &quot;public health pesticide&quot; as a minor use pesticide registered for use and used predominantly in public health programs for vector control or other health protection uses; and (2) &quot;vector&quot; as any organism capable of transmitting the causative agent of human disease or of producing human discomfort or injury. (Sec. 203) Exempts public health pesticides from certain fees if the Administrator determines that the economic return to the registrant from sales of the pesticide does not support the registration or reregistration of the pesticide. Provides for expedited processing and review of pesticide applications that propose the initial or amended registration of an end use pesticide that, if registered as proposed, would be used as a public health pesticide. (Sec. 204) Provides for review by the Secretary of Health and Human Services of registrations of public health pesticides proposed for cancellation. (Sec. 207) Directs the Administrator to identify pests of significant public health importance and to implement programs to improve and facilitate the safe use of methods to combat such pests. (Sec. 208) Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Antimicrobial Pesticides - Directs the Administrator to establish requirements for the registration of antimicrobial pesticides. Title IV: Expedited Review of Certain Pesticide Registrations - Directs the Administrator to establish an office to oversee and expedite the evaluation of applications for the registration of certain pesticides. (Sec. 402) Requires the Administrator to develop regulations and guidelines for the expedited review of applications for the registration of pesticides that meet the criteria of this section. Provides that biological pesticides will be presumed to qualify for expedited review. Directs the Administrator, in developing guidelines for expedited review, to consider the extent to which a pesticide may reasonably be expected to: (1) reduce the risks of pesticides to human health; (2) exhibit a high degree of specificity for the target pest and pose a low risk for nontarget organisms; (3) facilitate the management of pests while conserving existing natural controls; or (4) minimize the potential for groundwater or surface water contamination or other valued environmental resources. (Sec. 403) Authorizes the Administrator to conditionally register or amend registrations of pesticides that meet such criteria if the applicant agrees to: (1) generate any additional data that the Administrator deems appropriate; and (2) submit periodic reports as required. (Sec. 404) Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to encourage integrated pest management projects to be organized around specific pests and environmental problems faced by growers. (Sec. 405) Directs the Administrator, if the Secretary determines that pest resistance to a pesticide is detected and is likely to diminish the efficacy of the product or threatens to accelerate the evolution of resistance to other registrations of similar products, to provide technical assistance to applicants or registrants to: (1) develop a plan to minimize the potential for development of resistance; and (2) conduct monitoring and submit reports as necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the resistance plan.
