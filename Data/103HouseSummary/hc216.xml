	<summary>
	10/5/1994--Passed House amended. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Department of State, in its formal human rights dialogue with Vietnam, should place a high priority on seeking the release of all nonviolent political prisoners and reforms to bring Vietnam's legal procedures and practices into conformity with international human rights standards; (2) the Secretary of State should submit a progress report on such dialogue to the Congress within six months; and (3) the United States should actively support resolutions at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights expressing concern about the imprisonment of nonviolent political and religious dissidents in Vietnam, urge the Government of Vietnam to invite international humanitarian organizations to provide their confidential humanitarian services to prisoners in Vietnam, and consult with its allies to coordinate international public and private appeals for improvement in human rights in Vietnam. Declares that the President, in U.S. bilateral relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, should: (1) place a high priority on whether article 4 of the Vietnamese constitution and any other articles concerning &quot;democratic centralism&quot; and &quot;the leading role of the Communist party&quot; are repealed, whether article 69 (which strictly controls all religious activity is eliminated), and whether the Vietnamese Government and the Communist Party of Vietnam make formal commitments to permit free and fair elections; and (2) assess the progress that has occurred before taking steps to complete full normalization of relations.
