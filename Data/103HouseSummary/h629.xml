	1/26/1993--Introduced.
Improvement of Information Access Act of 1993 - Amends Federal law to require each executive and military department and independent establishment to prepare and make available to the public upon request a report which describes its information dissemination policies and practices. Requires each such entity to provide an opportunity for dialogue between responsible agency officials and interested members of the public regarding both proposed and existing policies, procedures, and mechanisms and disseminating information under this Act. Specifies the actions an agency must take before discontinuing an information product or service. Requires agencies to: (1) disseminate information in diverse modes and through appropriate outlets that will permit and broaden public access to Government information; and (2) use depository libraries, national computer networks, and other distribution channels that improve and assure free or low-cost public access to Government information. Provides that except as specifically authorized by statute, an agency may not: (1) charge to depository libraries the costs of distributing information products and services; (2) charge more than the incremental cost of distributing an information product or service regardless of channels utilized; or (3) charge any royalty or other fee for any use or redissemination of Government information. Requires the Archivist of the United States and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to jointly issue and periodically revise model performance standards under which agencies shall be encouraged to provide access to public records.
