	<summary>
	9/15/1993--Introduced.
Women Veterans Health Improvements Act of 1993 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that each health care facility under the jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans Affairs is able to provide in a timely and appropriate manner all authorized health care services to women veterans. Requires the provision of direct Department care (rather than by contract or other agreement) for women veterans in an area in which the number of such veterans makes it cost effective to do so. Prohibits mammograms from being performed at a Department facility unless such facility is accredited for such purpose by a private nonprofit organization designated by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to prescribe mammogram quality assurance and control standards and to perform periodic inspection of Department mammogram equipment and facilities. Requires the Secretary to ensure that such standards are equally applied to non-Federal facility or contractual providers of such services. Extends through 1996 the authority for the provision of counseling to women veterans for sexual trauma. Amends the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 to require each coordinator of women's services to serve in such position on a full-time basis. Requires the Secretary to ensure that such coordinators are fully able to carry out their responsibilities and provide women veterans with equal access to Department facilities. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a survey to identify deficiencies relating to women patient privacy in Department medical centers; (2) correct any such deficiencies; and (3) report to the Congress.
