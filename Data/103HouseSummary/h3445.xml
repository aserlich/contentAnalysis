	<summary>
	11/15/1993--Passed House amended. Hazard Mitigation and Flood Damage Reduction Act of 1993 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to increase from 50 to 75 percent of the cost of hazard mitigation measures the amount authorized to be contributed by the President when determined to be cost-effective while substantially reducing the damage or loss suffered in a major disaster. Increases the total Federal contributions authorized for such measures to 15 percent of the estimated aggregate amounts of grants to be provided under such Act for such disaster. Authorizes the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide property acquisition and relocation assistance as hazard mitigation measures for projects meeting specified requirements. Directs the Secretary of the Army to conduct studies: (1) to assess national flood control and floodplain management policies; and (2) of the Upper Mississippi and Lower Missouri rivers and their tributaries to identify potential solutions to flooding problems and to recommend water resource projects that would result in economically and environmentally justified flood damage reduction measures. Requires congressional reports after both studies. Authorizes Federal natural disaster emergency fund expenditures for implementation of nonstructural alternatives to the repair or restoration of flood control works if requested by the non-Federal sponsor. States that the purchase of any real property under a qualified buyout program (Government purchases of specified flood-damaged property) shall not constitute Federal assistance resulting in the acquisition of real property or in any owner of real property being a displaced person (for purposes of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970).
