	3/9/1993--Introduced.
Trade Agreements Compliance Act of 1993 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize an interested person to request the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to determine whether a foreign country is complying with any bilateral trade agreement to which the United States is a party (other than the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement or the Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the United States and Israel). Requires the USTR to take specified action under the Act if he or she determines that such country is in material noncompliance with such agreement. Requires the amendments made by this Act to be consistent with U.S. international obligations, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
