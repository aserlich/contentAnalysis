	4/20/1993--Introduced.
Film Disclosure Act of 1993 - Amends the Lanham Act to require that any distributor or network that proposes to exploit a materially altered motion picture bear a label which conspicuously discloses the fact of: (1) the film's material alteration from the form in which it was first released to the public; (2) the nature of such alteration; and (3) any objections raised by the artistic authors with reference to such alteration. Delineates the compliance procedure for distributors or networks that propose to exploit a materially altered film. Grants an artistic author the right to seek injunctive relief in U.S. district courts to prevent violation of his or her rights under this Act.
