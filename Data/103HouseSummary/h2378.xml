	<summary>
	6/10/1993--Introduced.
Prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from approving certain highway-related projects in any State which has a maximum speed limit in excess of 65 miles per hour (mph) on any highway which is located outside an urbanized area with a population of 50,000 or more and is constructed to interstate standards. (Eliminates the further condition under existing law that the highway is connected to the Interstate System.) Directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the effects on highway safety of increasing (under this Act) the maximum speed limit above 55 mph on highways with four lanes or more open to traffic.
