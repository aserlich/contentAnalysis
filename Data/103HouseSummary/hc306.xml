	<summary>
	10/4/1994--Introduced.
Commends President Clinton and Russian President Yeltsin for agreeing in the summit that was held on September 27-28, 1994, to deactivate enough nuclear forces, once START II is ratified, to reach the levels provided years earlier than the treaty requires and to intensify dialogue regarding further reductions of remaining nuclear forces. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should: (1) pursue negotiations with Russia as quickly as possible to achieve a START III agreement that reduces the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads to the lowest possible level, but in no case more than 2,000 each for the United States and Russia; (2) discuss with other countries with nuclear capabilities the possibility of future negotiations to reduce the levels of nuclear weapons; and (3) initiate negotiations with Russia to seek to dismantle all tactical nuclear weapons in the Russian and U.S. arsenals.
