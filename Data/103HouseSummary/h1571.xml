Restricted Weapons Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the possession or transfer of a restricted weapon, unless such weapon was lawfully possessed before the date it was most recently added to the published list required under this Act. Defines &quot;restricted weapon&quot; to mean any firearm which is on the list most recently published by the Secretary of the Treasury under this Act. Requires the Secretary to: (1) designate as a restricted weapon any semiautomatic rifle which is manufactured in the United States and is not generally recognized as suitable for, or readily adaptable to, sporting purposes and any firearm manufactured outside the United States the importation of which does not meet the sporting purposes standard; and (2) compile, publish, and periodically revise a list of the firearms so designated. Sets penalties for the unlawful possession or transfer of a restricted weapon. Provides for an enhanced penalty for possession or use of a restricted weapon during a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. Requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations governing the transfer of restricted weapons which shall allow such a transfer to proceed within 30 days after the Secretary receives the documentation submitted with respect to such a transfer. Authorizes the Secretary to assess a fee in connection with such a transfer. Sets penalties for violating such regulations. Prohibits: (1) the export of restricted weapons, with exceptions for U.S. departments or agencies and foreign governments (unless such a government engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights or has repeatedly provided support for international terrorism); and (2) the manufacture of a firearm to which a silencer or bayonet may be attached without alteration of the firearm. Sets penalties for violations of these provisions. Prohibits the possession or transfer of large capacity ammunition feeding devices, except where lawfully possessed before enactment of this Act. Defines such devices to include: (1) a detachable magazine, belt, or similar device which has, or can be readily converted to have, a capacity of more than seven rounds of ammunition; and (2) any part or combination of parts intended to convert a detachable magazine into such a device. Excludes from such definition any attached tubular device designed to accept and capable of operating with only .22 rimfire caliber ammunition. Sets penalties for violations. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations requiring manufacturers of such devices to stamp each such device with a permanent distinguishing mark.
