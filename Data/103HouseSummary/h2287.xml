Gaming Integrity and State Law Enforcement Act of 1993 - Amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to increase the membership of the National Indian Gaming Commission. Grants the Commission the authority to approve certain tribal gaming regulations. Revises conditions for regulation of Class II and Class III gaming activities on Indian lands. Limits gaming to the specific forms of, and methods of play for, those gaming activities expressly authorized by the law of the State. Revises provisions with respect to Class II licensing of persons other than Indian tribes. Places a moratorium on Tribal-State gaming compacts. Excludes video bingo from the definition of Class II gaming. Includes video bingo, and any other forms of electronic video games or devices, as well as slot machines, within the definition of Class III gaming. Shifts the burden of proof from a State to the United States in a compact negotiation action initiated by the United States on behalf of a tribe. Sets forth restrictions with respect to gaming on after-acquired lands (with a special provision for lands in Oklahoma). Subjects Indian gaming establishments to specified reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Requires the Attorney General to conduct specified background investigations of directors, financial backers, and key employees of Class III establishments. Amends Federal law to apply State gambling laws to Indian lands to the same extent that they apply to non-Indian lands. Grants the United States exclusive jurisdiction over related criminal prosecutions, with specified exceptions.
