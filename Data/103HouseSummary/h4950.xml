(Sec. 102) Authorizes OPIC to transfer amounts from noncredit activities to pay subsidy costs of program levels for the direct loan and investment guaranties programs. (Sec. 103) Continues OPIC's authority to issue investment insurance and guarantees through FY 1996. (Sec. 105) Makes a restriction on OPIC assistance for countries that exceed a specified per capita income level inapplicable to Ireland and Northern Ireland (thus making such countries eligible for OPIC assistance). Title II: Trade and Development Agency - Authorizes appropriations for the Trade and Development Agency for FY 1995 and 1996. Title III: Export Promotion Programs Within the International Trade Administration - Amends the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 to authorize appropriations for Department of Commerce export promotion programs for FY 1995 and 1996. Title IV: Promotion of United States Environmental Exports - Environmental Export Promotion Act of 1994 - Amends the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 to remove provisions relating to Environmental Export Assistance Officers. (Sec. 402) Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish the Environmental Technologies Trade Advisory Committee to provide guidance on programs to expand U.S. exports of environmental technologies, goods, and services and products that comply with U.S. environmental, safety, and related requirements. Requires the Environmental Trade Promotion Working Group, a subcommittee of the Trade Promotion Coordination Committee (TPCC), to: (1) select five priority countries with the greatest potential for the application of U.S. Government export promotion resources related to environmental exports; and (2) create a plan annually for each such country that sets forth ways to increase such exports to such country. Directs the Secretary to assign a specialist in environmental technologies to the office of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service in each of the priority countries. Authorizes the TPCC to establish international regional initiatives to coordinate the activities of Federal agencies in order to build environmental partnerships between the United States and the geographic regions outside the United States for which such initiatives are established. Provides that such partnerships shall enhance environmental protection and promote sustainable development by using the technical expertise and financial resources of Federal agencies that provide foreign assistance and by expanding U.S. exports of environmental technologies, goods, and services to such regions. Directs the Working Group to maintain a calendar of significant opportunities for U.S. environmental businesses in foreign markets and trade promotion events to be made available to the public. Authorizes the Secretary to use the Market Development Cooperator Program to support regional alliances of private sector entities, nonprofit organizations, and universities that support the export of environmental technologies, goods, and services and promote the export of products complying with U.S. environmental, safety, and related requirements. Title V: International Protection of Intellectual Property - Requires the President, acting through the Administrator of the Agency for International Development, to establish a program of training and technical assistance to assist foreign countries in: (1) developing and strengthening laws and regulations to protect intellectual property; and (2) developing the infrastructure necessary to implement and enforce such laws and regulations.
