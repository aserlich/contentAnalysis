	5/10/1994--Introduced.
AIDS Cure Act - Requires the President to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a project to develop a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Prohibits the program from being administered by any officer or employee of the National Institutes of Health. Requires the Governing Council established in this Act to ensure that the project: (1) pursues comprehensive basic science investigations, based on diverse theories and schools of thought which elucidate the pathogenesis of AIDS; and (2) identifies, based on this work, all promising curatives and oversees their timely and adequate testing. Establishes a Governing Council to set policy and oversee research priorities, ethical standards, conflict of interest rules, and hiring of researchers and administrators. Establishes a coordinating committee to facilitate communication among the different scientists working on the project, evaluate the progress of its work, and convene the entire staff on a regular schedule (or when necessary) to evaluate the progress of the project as a whole, identify gaps in research, reevaluate its direction, and consider newly developed theories emanating from both within and outside the project. Requires the Secretary to convene a one-time national AIDS Congress solely to make recommendations to the President for selecting the Governing Council. Grants the Secretary extraordinary powers in carrying out such project, including the power to exercise the right of eminent domain to obtain samples of potential curatives and data on their development. Vests power in the Congress to reauthorize the project after five years of operation.
