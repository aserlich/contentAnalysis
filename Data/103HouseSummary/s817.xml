	4/22/1993--Introduced.
Federal Resource Efficient Building Materials Act of 1993 - Requires the Administrator of General Services to establish a three-year pilot program to demonstrate the acquisition and use of resource efficient building materials in Federal facilities and buildings. Directs the Administrator, in the selection of such materials, to use the criteria of: (1) maximizing the conservation and preservation of natural resources; (2) ensuring that such materials are similar in quality and durability and are cost competitive to comparable, more conventional materials; (3) meeting appropriate environmental, public health, and safety standards; and (4) meeting appropriate energy efficiency standards. Establishes the Resource Efficient Building Material Advisory Board to advise and make recommendations to the Administrator concerning developments and uses of resource efficient building materials in Federal construction and the minimization of solid waste generation in such construction. Authorizes appropriations.
