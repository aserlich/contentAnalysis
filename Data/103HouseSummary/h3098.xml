	<summary>
	11/20/1993--Passed House amended. Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit: (1) the sale, delivery, or transfer to a juvenile, or to a person who the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile, of a handgun or ammunition that is suitable for use only in a handgun; and (2) the possession by a juvenile of a handgun or such ammunition. Makes exceptions with respect to: (1) certain temporary transfers of a handgun or ammunition to a juvenile, or to possession or use of a handgun or ammunition by a juvenile, if the handgun and ammunition are possessed and used by the juvenile in the course of employment or ranching or farming related to activities at the juvenile's residence, target practice, hunting, or a course of instruction in the safe and lawful use of a handgun, with the prior written consent of the juvenile's parent or guardian, subject to specified requirements, and in accordance with State and local law; (2) transportation by the juvenile of an unloaded handgun in a locked container, under specified circumstances; (3) a juvenile who is a member of the U.S. armed forces or the National Guard who possesses or is armed with a handgun in the line of duty; (4) a transfer by inheritance of title (but not possession) of a handgun or ammunition to a juvenile; or (5) the possession of a handgun or ammunition by a juvenile taken in defense of the juvenile or other persons against an intruder into the residence of the juvenile or a residence in which the juvenile is an invited guest. Directs the court to require the presence of a juvenile defendant's parent or legal guardian at all proceedings for violations of this Act, except for good cause shown. Sets: (1) limits on the permanent confiscation by the Government of a handgun or ammunition from a juvenile; and (2) penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) evaluate existing and proposed juvenile handgun legislation in each State; (2) develop model juvenile handgun legislation that is constitutional and enforceable; (3) prepare and disseminate to State authorities the findings made as the result of the evaluation; and (4) report to the Congress regarding the need or appropriateness of further Government action.
