Requires the President to impose sanctions unless he certifies to the Congress that a government has taken actions to terminate the involvement of a foreign person in such activities. Exempts certain products or services from sanctions, including essential defense articles and services, products and services provided under existing contracts, essential technology or information, and humanitarian items. Applies sanctions for at least 12 months and terminates sanctions only if the President certifies to the Congress that a person has ceased to, and will not in the future, aid in such prohibited activities.

(Sec. 206) Amends the Export-Import Bank Act to prohibit Export-Import Bank assistance to any country that has aided or abetted a non-nuclear weapon state in acquiring a nuclear explosive device or unsafeguarded nuclear material.
