	<summary>
	11/19/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Tech-Prep Education Act to revise tech-prep education program contents to include the two or four years of secondary school preceding graduation (currently just the final two years), as well as two years of higher education or an apprenticeship program. Includes among consortia members businesses, industries, or labor unions, and institutions of higher education that award baccalaureate degrees. Revises special consideration provisions. Gives highest priority to applications that provide for effective employment placement activities or transfer of students to four-year baccalaureate programs.
