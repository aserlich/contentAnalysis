Lists programs and activities exempt from sequestration and provides exceptions, limitations, and special rules.

Title IV: Balanced Budget by Fiscal Year 2000 - Requires reduction of the maximum deficit amount to zero by FY 2000. Allows a waiver or suspension on the prohibition on exceeding such amount by a three-fifths vote of both Houses. Allows a waiver or suspension on exceeding the public debt limit by a three-fifths vote of both Houses. Excludes social security from the budget process.
