(Sec. 303) Limits to $100,000 what any person may be required to pay in a single payment in damages for expenses to be incurred in the future, but allows for periodic payments. States that the total amount of damages received by an individual shall be reduced by any other compensatory payments received under certain Federal, State, or private programs. Sets a statute of limitations for medical malpractice liability claims of two years after an alleged injury should reasonably have been discovered, but in no event more than four years after the alleged injury occurred (or in the case of a minor under age six, no later than the tenth birthday). Sets forth limitations on attorney's fees. (Sec. 304) Prohibits the application of strict liability to any manufacturer or seller of a health care product approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any injury alleged to have resulted from: (1) a defect in product design; or (2) a failure to warn or instruct regarding a risk posed by the product that was neither known nor reasonably knowable at the time the product left the manufacturer's or seller's control. States that a manufacturer or seller of a health care product that is to be prescribed by, or used at the direction of, a health care professional shall not be liable (except in specified circumstances) for harm allegedly caused by a failure to warn or instruct the ultimate product user or recipient (unless the FDA specifically requires a warning or instruction to the ultimate user or recipient), if the manufacturer or seller provided adequate warning or instruction to the user's or recipient's health care professional. (Sec. 305) Limits to $250,000 the total amount of noneconomic damages awardable to a plaintiff and family for losses resulting from the injury which is the subject of a medical malpractice liability action.

(Sec. 603) Directs the Attorney General to publish a notice in the Federal Register soliciting proposals for additional safe harbors and to review and report to the Congress on proposed safe harbors. Sets forth criteria in establishing safe harbors, including: (1) the extent to which a competitive or collaborative activity will accomplish an increase in health care access and quality, the establishment of cost efficiencies, and increased ability of health care facilities to provide services in medically underserved areas or to underserved populations; and (2) whether designation as a safe harbor will result in specified desirable outcomes. (Sec. 604) Directs the Attorney General to issue certificates of review for providers of health care services and to assist persons in applying for such certificates.
