Permits a deduction for medical education loan interest incurred by health professionals serving in medically underserved rural areas. Provides a credit for a qualified primary health services provider providing primary health services full time to individuals residing in a rural health professional shortage area and who: (1) is not receiving a National Health Service Corps Scholarship or a loan repayment under the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program; (2) is not fulfilling service obligations under such Programs; and (3) has not defaulted on such obligations. Provides for an increase in the amount which may be expensed as depreciable business assets in the case of rural health care property. Title II: Public Health Service Programs Regarding Rural Health Care - Amends the Public Health Service Act to add additional criteria for use in determining health professional shortage areas by including in the criteria the number of individuals paying for health services through Medicare or Medicaid and the number of individuals who have no health insurance, as well as the number of physicians who will accept Medicare and Medicaid patients. (Sec. 202) Requires that at least five percent of appropriations for the National Health Service Corps be used for special loans for former Corps members to enter private practice in health professional shortage areas. (Sec. 211) Provides increased funding for the Scholarship Program and the Loan Repayment Program. (Sec. 212) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to give priority in making scholarships to individuals from rural backgrounds who are likely, after their service, to serve in a rural health professional shortage area. (Sec. 221) Establishes in the Treasury the Rural Primary Health Care Funds for the purpose of making loans to assist individuals with the costs of attending professions schools if the individuals agree to provide primary health services in an underserved rural area. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 231) Requires a State, in order for the State to receive a grant for an Office of Rural Health, to undertake activities to recruit and train physicians to serve in rural areas. Authorizes appropriations for such Offices. (Sec. 232) Authorizes and increases appropriations through FY 1997 for area health education center programs. Title III: Provisions Relating to the Medicare Program - Amends the Social Security Act to: (1) eliminate the geographic adjustment factor, beginning in 1999, with respect to payment amounts for physicians' services; (2) exempt rural hospitals from anti-kickback penalties for certain incentives provided to a physician, if the incentives are contingent upon the physician practicing in the area; and (3) extend the incentive payment for physicians' services furnished in a shortage area to certain nonphysician providers. Title IV: Treatment of Student Loans for Health Professionals - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to defer certain student loan repayments for a borrower who is serving in an internship or residency program in a health facility located in a rural area.
