	5/12/1994--Introduced.
Telecommunications Services Enhancement Act of 1994 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit any State or local governmental entity, statute, or regulation from: (1) prohibiting the ability of an entity to provide interstate or intrastate telecommunications services; or (2) unreasonably discriminating among telecommunications carriers. Authorizes a Bell operating company or its affiliate to engage in the provision of interLATA (local access and transport areas) telecommunications services when the barriers to entry for the provision of interstate or intrastate telecommunications services have been removed. Prohibits a cable operator from providing telephone exchange service or telephone exchange access service in the geographic area where it provides video programming so long as the local exchange carrier (LEC) for such area is prohibited from providing video programming directly to its subscribers. Requires the Federal Communications Commission to promulgate regulations ensuring that all providers of competitive telecommunications services are subject to equivalent regulation. Authorizes (current law prohibits) an LEC to: (1) provide video programming to its subscribers either directly or through an affiliate; and (2) provide channels of communication or pole line, conduit space, or other rental arrangements to an entity directly owned, operated, or controlled by the LEC to be used to provide video programming directly to subscribers.
