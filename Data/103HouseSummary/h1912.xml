	4/28/1993--Introduced.
Federal Employee Family-Building Act of 1993 - Requires any contract for health benefits for Federal employees that provides obstetrical benefits to also provide benefits for family-building procedures (i.e. medical procedures to achieve full term pregnancy and procedures related to child adoption). Provides that payment terms or conditions under such contracts shall be no more restrictive for family-building benefits than for obstetrical benefits. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to authorize the use of sick leave for purposes relating to family-building procedures.
