Community Policing Assistance Act of 1993 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to units of local government and community groups in economically distressed central cities to establish or expand cooperative efforts between police and community for purposes of increasing police presence in the community. Requires the Director to develop a written model that informs community members regarding: (1) how to identify the existence of a drug or gang house; (2) what civil remedies, such as public nuisance violations and civil suits in small claims court, are available; and (3) what mediation techniques are available between community members and individuals who have established a drug or gang house in such community. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) grant application requirements; (2) allocation of funds and grant renewal; (3) criteria for awarding grants; and (4) reporting requirements. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to determine the need adjusted per capita income for certain economically distressed central cities, based on a specified formula. Authorizes appropriations.
