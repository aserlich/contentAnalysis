	10/27/1993--Introduced.
International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for removing a child from, or retaining a child outside, the United States with intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of parental rights. Establishes as an affirmative defense that the defendant: (1) acted within the provisions of a valid court order granting custody or visitation rights obtained pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act; (2) was fleeing domestic violence; and (3) had physical custody of the child pursuant to a court order, failed to return the child as a result of circumstances beyond his or her control, notified or made reasonable attempts to notify the other parent or lawful custodian of the child of such circumstances within 24 hours after the visitation period had expired, and returned the child as soon as possible. Expresses the sense of the Congress that procedures under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Parental Child Abduction should be the option of first choice for a parent who seeks the return of a child who has been removed from the parent. Authorizes appropriations to carry out (under the State Justice Institute Act of 1984) national, regional, and in-State training and educational programs dealing with criminal and civil aspects of interstate and international parental child abduction.
