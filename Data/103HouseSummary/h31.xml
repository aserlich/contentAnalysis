Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure, and Health Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue water quality criteria for pathogens in coastal recreation waters. Requires States to adopt consistent water quality standards. Requires the Administrator to publish regulations specifying methods to be used by States to monitor coastal recreation waters, during periods of use by the public, for compliance with standards. Requires notification of local governments and the public of water quality standards violations. Requires the Administrator to: (1) issue guidance on uniform assessment and monitoring procedures for floatable materials in coastal recreation waters; and (2) specify the conditions under which the presence of floatable material constitutes a threat to public health and safety. Requires an ongoing study and report to the Congress on developing better indicators for detecting harmful bacteria and viruses in coastal recreation waters. Requires State coastal zone management agencies to provide technical assistance to local governments to ensure that coastal recreation waters and beaches are as free as possible from floatable materials. Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to authorize grants to eligible coastal States for the reduction of floatable materials in coastal recreation waters. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States to fulfill requirements under this Act. Authorizes appropriations.
