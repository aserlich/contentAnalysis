	3/25/1994--Introduced.
Publicly Owned Treatment Works Biological Monitoring Use Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require permits for discharges from publicly owned treatment works to contain terms for biological monitoring or whole effluent toxicity tests if the permitting authority determines that such discharges cause, have the potential to cause, or contribute to an in-stream excursion above a narrative or numeric criterion for whole effluent toxicity. Outlines the process for such tests. Provides that if the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines that it is necessary to include biological monitoring, testing, or assessment methods or whole effluent toxicity tests as a permit condition for publicly owned treatment works, the failure of such tests shall not result in a finding of violation.
