	10/20/1993--Introduced.
Prohibits funds appropriated or otherwise available to the Department of Defense from being obligated or expended for activities of any element of the armed forces that is under the operational control of a foreign national acting on behalf of the United Nations, unless the President certifies to the Congress that such operational control is necessary to protect vital U.S. national security interests. Requires a follow-up report from the President to the Congress within ten days after such a certification. Provides an exception to such prohibition in the case of elements involving fewer than 100 members of the armed forces in any one country.
