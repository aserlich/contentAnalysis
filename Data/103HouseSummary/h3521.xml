	11/16/1993--Introduced.
Establishes a National Commission on Crime and Violence in America. Includes among the duties of the Commission to: (1) review the effectiveness of traditional criminal justice approaches in preventing and controlling crime and violence; (2) convene hearings in various parts of the country; (3) develop a comprehensive and effective crime control and antiviolence plan that will serve as a blueprint for action in the 1990's and which reaches out beyond the traditional criminal justice community for ideas; and (4) study the economic and social factors leading to or contributing to, and specific proposals for legislative and administrative actions to reduce, crime and violence.
