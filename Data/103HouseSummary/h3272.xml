Law Enforcement and Correctional Officers Employment Registration Act of 1993 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require the Governor of each State (and the chief executive officer of each U.S. territory) that receives drug control and system improvement formula grants to: (1) submit to an officer or agency designated by the Attorney General (designee) a list of all law enforcement and correctional officers who held such office in such State or territory on or since January 1, 1990 (including their dates of birth, social security numbers, Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprint identification numbers, dates of appointment as officers, names and addresses or National Crime Information Center numbers of the appointing or employing agencies, and dates such service ended); (2) update and supplement such list; and (3) notify the designee of an officer's employment, appointment, or separation. Directs each State, territory, or political subdivision to require all applicants for such positions before beginning employment to: (1) disclose all prior service or employment as an officer; and (2) submit a written authorization and request for release of information. Directs the Attorney General, when a prospective employer obtains an officer's request for release of information, to release data collected pursuant to this Act to the employer. Makes agencies or agency administrators who submit employment or officer certification data pursuant to this Act immune from civil liability for such disclosure or its consequences, except upon a showing of lack of good faith by clear and convincing evidence.
