(Sec. 102) Requires such a plan to provide for all medically necessary acute medical care (including physician services; inpatient, outpatient, and emergency hospital services and appropriate alternatives to hospitalization; and inpatient and outpatient prescription drugs), to not exclude coverage for selected illnesses or selected treatments if consistent with medically accepted practices, and to meet applicable cost-sharing requirements of this Act. Requires that such plan, in the case of a high deductible umbrella insurance plan, provide a deductible amount for benefits provided in any plan year which is at least $1,500 (but not to exceed $3,000) for items and services furnished to a family (composed of one or more individuals) enrolled under the plan in a year. Specifies that a health insurance plan may not require the payment of any copayment or coinsurance for an item or service for which coverage is required after an individual or a family has incurred out-of-pocket expenses equal to a specified limit for a plan year. (Sec. 103) Requires that such a plan provide: (1) for a variation in premium rates only on the basis of age, sex, geography, and family enrollment, individual and group coverage, and in the case of group coverage, on the basis of the number of individuals covered within the group; (2) for a charge of the same premium rates to new applicants and existing policyholders with the same age, sex, geographic characteristics, and family enrollment; and (3) that the highest premium for the plan for a particular class of family enrollment and geographic characteristics may not exceed four times the lowest premium for such plan for the same enrollment and geographic characteristics. Permits incentive discounts of not more than ten percent for participating in an approved program to promote healthy behavior, prevent or delay the onset of illness, or provide for screening or early detection of illness. (Sec. 104) Requires that such plan: (1) provide guaranteed issue at standard rates to all applicants; and (2) not exclude from coverage, or limit coverage for, any preexisting condition, with exceptions. (Sec. 105) Requires that such plan provide the policyholder with a contractual right to renew the coverage which stipulates that the insurer cannot cancel or refuse to renew the coverage except for cases of nonpayment of premiums, or fraud or misrepresentation, by the policyholder. (Sec. 106) Sets forth restrictions on agent compensation and broker activities. Part 2: Certification of High Deductible Umbrella Insurance Plans and Managed Care Health Plans - Requires each State to submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a report on steps the State is taking to implement and enforce a regulatory program with respect to high deductible umbrella insurance plans and managed care health plans by a specified deadline. Directs the Secretary, upon determining that a State has failed to submit a report by the deadline or that the State has not implemented and provided adequate enforcement of the regulatory program, to give the State 60 days to submit such report or implement and enforce such program. Sets forth procedures for Federal enforcement if such failure has not been corrected. (Sec. 112) Directs the Secretary to develop State regulatory program standards, in the form of model Acts and model regulations, which include: (1) procedures for certifying that the requirements of part 1 of this subtitle have been met by a health insurance plan applying for certification as a high deductible umbrella insurance plan or a managed care health plan; (2) specified requirements regarding marketing practices and reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanisms with respect to such a plan; (3) requirements regarding solvency standards and guaranty funds for carriers of such plans; and (4) reporting requirements under which carriers report to the Internal Revenue Service regarding the acquisition and termination by individuals of coverage under such plans. Directs the Secretary to: (1) request the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to develop models for reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanisms for high deductible umbrella insurance plans and managed care health plans made available to individuals for whom an insurer is at risk of incurring high costs under the plan; and (2) review such models to determine if they provide for an effective reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanism. Requires each State to establish one or more reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanisms consistent with such a model. Permits a State to establish and maintain such a mechanism jointly with other States. Directs the Secretary to establish and maintain a reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanism if a State has failed to establish or maintain such a mechanism. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on the providing of any high deductible umbrella insurance plan or managed care health plan which covers any individual in a Federal reinsurance State. Directs that the tax imposed equal the applicable percentage of the amount received by the insurer for providing such plan in such Federal reinsurance State. Makes the insurer liable for payment of the tax. Subtitle B: Promoting Development of Voluntary Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives - Directs the Secretary to establish standards relating to the establishment of health plan purchasing cooperatives (HPPCs), qualifications for qualified health carriers, and the roles of States under this subtitle. Sets forth provisions regarding deadlines, revision of standards, application of standards through States, the Federal role, and implementation of the standards. (Sec. 122) Requires each State to establish boundaries for HPPC areas in the State. (Sec. 123) Authorizes the establishment of one or more State-chartered, nonprofit private corporations to serve as an HPPC for each HPPC area for the benefit of small employers and eligible individuals in the area. Specifies that a carrier may not form, underwrite, or possess a majority vote of an HPPC, but may administer an HPPC. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the establishment by each HPPC of bylaws; (2) the election of members of its board of directors; (3) limitation of liability for good faith actions taken by any member of the board, its employees, or agent in the performance of duties of HPPCs; (4) appointment of officers and an executive director; (5) reporting, recordkeeping, and audit requirements; and (6) general authorities and limits on the authority of HPPCs. (Sec. 124) Requires each HPPC to: (1) enter into contracts and hold policies with qualified health carriers which elect to offer HPPC plans to members; (2) provide for the enrollment of eligible employees of small employers and eligible individuals in HPPC plans of qualified health carriers offered by the HPPC; (3) provide to its members and eligible employees of small employer members comparison sheets with clear standardized information on each qualified health carrier and each HPPC plan offered by a qualified health carrier; (4) establish requirements for participation of small employers and eligible individuals as HPPC members consistent with any standards established by the Secretary and to maintain eligibility records; and (5) establish dispute resolution procedures to resolve disputes between the HPPC and its members or qualified health carriers. Sets forth requirements concerning: (1) contracts with members; (2) contracts with plans; (3) overhead allowance; (4) uniform administrative and accounting procedures; and (5) contracts for administrative services. (Sec. 125) Requires each State to establish a process whereby a carrier that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State insurance commissioner that it has the capability to fulfill specified requirements (with regard to licensure, administrative capacity, access, grievance procedures, utilization management procedures, quality, information, and data elements) is designated as a qualified health carrier. Sets forth the functions of qualified health carriers. Requires that coverage under an HPPC plan offered by a qualified health carrier be available to any member of the HPPC at the anniversary date of each member's coverage under an HPPC plan, with exceptions and subject to specified conditions. (Sec. 126) Requires each: (1) HPPC to use efficient and standardized means to notify small employers of the availability of plans through the HPPC and to notify the State insurance commissioner of any marketing practices or materials that it finds contrary to the fair marketing of qualified health carriers and HPPC plans; and (2) State insurance commissioner to monitor compliance with marketing requirements. (Sec. 127) Requires: (1) each HPPC to submit specified data to the State on a quarterly basis; and (2) the Secretary to establish uniform standards for data that an HPPC collects from qualified health carriers and providers and disseminates. (Sec. 128) Requires each State to: (1) assure compliance of HPPCs, small employers, and eligible employees and individuals with the requirements of this subtitle and to conduct reviews at least annually on the performance of each HPPC in assuring access to health coverage to small employers and eligible individuals in the HPPC area; (2) receive, review, and act on appeals of unresolved disputes between an HPPC and a member; (3) analyze information collected from qualified health carriers and other sources and report findings that assist consumers, HPPCs, qualified health carriers, or health care providers in improving the delivery or purchase of cost-effective health care; (4) prepare and make available to HPPCs and employers located in the State (and to eligible individuals upon request) information, in comparative form, concerning the HPPC plans in the State and HPPCs operating in the State; (5) report to the Secretary annually on the impact of the reform under this subtitle in expanding the availability and affordability of health coverage to eligible employees and individuals; and (6) supervise HPPCs to ensure that actions that affect market competition accomplish the objectives of this title, so as to provide State and Federal protection to HPPCs and HPPC boards of directors against Federal and State antitrust laws. Subtitle C: Federal Preemption - Bars applicability of any provision of State or local law that: (1) in the case of a group health plan, requires the coverage of one or more specific benefits, services, or categories of health care, or services of any class or type of provider of health care; and (2) prohibits two or more employers from obtaining coverage under an insured multiple employer health plan. (Sec. 143) Preempts and makes unenforceable specified State law restrictions with respect to reimbursement rates or selective contracting, differential financial incentives, and utilization review methods. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study of the benefits and cost effectiveness of the use of managed care in the delivery of health services.

Subtitle D: Rules of Construction Regarding Abortion Services; Inseverability - Specifies that: (1) nothing in this title or title II may be construed to require any health plan to include any abortion services or to condition tax deductibility on the inclusion of such services; and (2) if such provision is judicially determined to be invalid all the provisions of this title and title II shall be deemed to be invalid. Title II: Amendments of Internal Revenue Code of 1986 - Subtitle A: Limitations on Employer Deduction for Health Care Coverage for Employees and on Employee Exclusion for Employer-Provided Health Care Coverage - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an employer a deduction: (1) for health care coverage for employees under a high deductible umbrella insurance plan or a managed health care plan; (2) for contribution to a medical savings account for an employee; or (3) for payment of permitted coverage. Prohibits such deduction from exceeding the health care tax benefit limitation imposed on individuals receiving coverage under a tax-qualified health care plan. (Sec. 202) Excludes from the gross income of an employee only coverage under a tax-qualified health care plan, contributions to a medical savings account, or permitted coverage payments. (Sec. 203) Prohibits the provision of health benefits under cafeteria plans. Subtitle B: Credits for Contributions to Medical Savings Accounts, for Purchase of High Deduction Umbrella Insurance, and for Routine Preventive Care - Allows individuals a tax credit (with limitation) for a percentage of contributions to a medical savings account. Makes such account tax-exempt and excludes other employer payments from the individual's tax base.

Title III: Savings in Medicare and Medicaid Programs - Subtitle A: Medicare Program - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an annual tax on the Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) premiums of high-income and certain other individuals covered by such part. (Sec. 302) Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to: (1) impose a co-payment for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests; (2) eliminate mandatory assignment for test payment and billing; and (3) provide for annual indexing of the part B deductible. Subtitle B: Medicaid Program - Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to: (1) cap Federal payments for acute medical services; (2) discontinue reimbursement standards for inpatient hospital services; (3) provide for optional enrollment of low-income individuals under high deductible umbrella insurance plans and managed care plans (with reduced payment adjustments for States providing such enrollment); (4) allow States more flexibility in contracting for coordinated care services; and (5) prohibit Medicaid funding of abortions not necessary to prevent the death of the mother. Title IV: Containing Health Care Costs - Subtitle A: Medical Malpractice Liablity Reform - Part 1: General Provisions - Makes this subtitle applicable with respect to any medical malpractice liability claim and action brought in any State or Federal court, with exceptions (such as a claim or action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death). Sets forth provisions regarding preemption, effect on sovereign immunity and choice of law or venue, and Federal court jurisdiction. Part 2: Medical Malpractice and Product Liability Reform - Prohibits a medical malpractice liability action from being brought in any: (1) State court during a calendar year unless the medical malpractice liability claim that is the subject of the action has been initially resolved under a State's alternative dispute resolution (ADR) system certified for the year by the Secretary or under the alternative Federal system established by this Act; and (2) Federal court during a calendar year unless such claim that is the subject of the action has been initially resolved under such ADR system in the State whose law applies. Directs the Attorney General to establish an ADR process for the resolution of medical malpractice liability claims brought against the United States, which shall occur after the completion of the administrative claim process. Prohibits a medical malpractice liability action based on such a claim from being brought in any Federal court unless the claim has been initially resolved under the ADR process established by the Attorney General. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) procedures for filing actions; and (2) the legal effect of uncontested ADR decisions. (Sec. 412) Sets a $250,000 limit on noneconomic damages that may be awarded to a claimant and the members of the claimant's family for losses resulting from the injury which is the subject of a medical malpractice liability action. Prohibits the award of punitive or exemplary damages in such an action: (1) unless the claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the injury suffered was the direct result of conduct manifesting a malicious, wanton, willful, or excessively reckless disregard of the safety of others; and (2) against the manufacturer of a medical product. Requires that: (1) any punitive or exemplary damages awarded in a medical malpractice liability action be paid to the State in which the action is brought or, in a case brought in Federal court, in the State in which the health care services that caused the injury that is the subject of the action were provided; and (2) such State use such amounts to carry out activities to assure the safety and quality of health care services provided in the State. Prohibits a defendant, in any medical malpractice liability action in which the damages awarded for future economic loss exceed $100,000, from being required to pay such damages in a single, lump-sum payment, but permits periodic payments based on when the damages are found likely to occur, as determined by the court. Authorizes a court to waive the application of such provision if it is not in the best interests of the plaintiff to receive periodic payments. (Sec. 413) Directs the court in a medical malpractice liability action to require the party that contested an ADR ruling with respect to the medical malpractice liability claim that is the subject of the action to: (1) pay attorney fees and other costs, with exceptions; and (2) post a performance bond, subject to waiver by the court upon determining that the posting of such a bond is not necessary to ensure that the party pay the costs incurred by the opposing party under the action. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) limits on attorney's fees paid; and (2) recordkeeping requirements. (Sec. 414) Allows a defendant to be held severally but not jointly liable in a medical malpractice action for noneconomic damages, and only for those damages directly attributable to the person's proportionate share of fault or responsibility for the injury. (Sec. 415) Establishes a seven-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice liability claims beginning on the date the alleged injury occurred. (Sec. 416) Prohibits a defendant in a medical malpractice liability action from being found to have acted negligently unless the defendant's conduct at the time of providing the health care services was not reasonable.
