Improved Budget Presentation Act - Establishes the Commission on the Presentation of the Budget of the United States to study and report to the President and the Congress on recommendations to provide improved governmental processes in the formulation, presentation, and implementation of the Federal budget with respect to: (1) the ability of the budget to distinguish between capital and operating activities, and between operating and trust funds, to identify the resources needed to meet the Government's needs; (2) improved procedures among Federal departments, agencies, independent establishments, and instrumentalities to provide improved coordination and control with respect to the budget; and (3) more effective arrangements between the executive branch and the Congress which will better enable each to carry out its budgeting, revenue, and appropriation responsibilities.
