Community Partnerships Against Crime Amendments Act - Amends the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Act of 1990 (the Act) to create a new chapter (which may be cited as the Community Partnerships Against Crime Act of 1993), under which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may make grants for use in eliminating crime in and around public housing and other federally assisted low-income housing projects to public housing agencies (PHAs) and private, for-profit and nonprofit owners of federally assisted low-income housing. Revises the Act to include among authorized uses of grant funds: (1) providing funding to nonprofit public housing resident management corporations and resident councils to develop security and crime prevention programs involving site residents; (2) the employment or utilization of individuals, including law enforcement officers, made available by contract or other cooperative arrangement with State or local law enforcement agencies, to engage in community- and problem-oriented policing involving interaction with members of the community in proactive crime control and prevention activities; (3) programs and activities for or involving youth; and (4) service programs for residents that address the contributing factors of crime. Expands the use of anti-drug crime public housing grants to cover all crime. Requires the Secretary, in each fiscal year, to make a grant to each PHA that owns or operates 250 or more public housing dwelling units that has submitted an application for a grant for such fiscal year which includes a five-year crime deterrence and reduction plan that has been approved by the Secretary, subject to specified requirements. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) plan requirements, grant amounts, performance reviews, submission of applications, plan review and approval, disapproval of applications, and failure to approve or disapprove an application or plan; (2) requirements for PHAs with fewer than 250 units and owners of federally assisted low-income housing; and (3) criteria for approval of applications and additional criteria for federally assisted low-income housing. Establishes requirements regarding technical assistance and funding allocation. Authorizes appropriations, including appropriations for public housing youth sports programs.
