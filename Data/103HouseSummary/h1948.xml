	4/29/1993--Introduced.
Former Soviet Union Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1993 - Directs the President to establish a program to reduce the environmental and national security threats from nuclear facilities in the former Soviet Union. Requires the President to establish multilateral technical working groups with the appropriate independent states of the former Soviet Union and other nations capable of producing nuclear weapons to examine monitoring and inspection arrangements that could be applied to verification. Authorizes the President to provide assistance under this Act only upon certification to the Congress that the country: (1) has ratified the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START I); (2) has acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; (3) is eligible for specified demilitarization and nonproliferation and disarmament assistance under other Acts; and (4) will not use assistance to support the continued operation or enhancement of plants for chemical separation of plutonium from fission products in spent nuclear fuel. Sets forth reporting requirements. Transfers funds from amounts appropriated to the Department of Energy for prior years for programs under this Act.
