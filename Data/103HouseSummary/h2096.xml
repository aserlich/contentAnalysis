Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to require the Export-Import Bank of the United States to take into account the potential beneficial and adverse environmental effects of projects for the export of goods and services in cases where medium- or long-term support of $7 million (currently, $10 million for long-term) or more is requested from the Bank for such projects. Directs the Bank to encourage the use of its programs to support the export of goods and services that have beneficial effects environmentally such as by encouraging environmentally sustainable development, promoting efficient use of resources, and promoting energy efficiency.
