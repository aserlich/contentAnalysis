	3/2/1993--Introduced.
Preemption Clarification and Information Act of 1993 - Provides that no Federal statute shall preempt any State or local government law, ordinance, or regulation (law) unless the statute explicitly states that such preemption is intended, or unless there is a direct conflict between the statute and a State or local law that cannot be reconciled. Directs the Congressional Research Service to prepare and make public, after each Congress adjourns sine die, a report on the extent of Federal statutory preemption of State and local government powers enacted into law during the preceding Congress or adopted through judicial interpretation of Federal statutes. Requires copies of such report to be sent to the President and appropriate congressional committee chairmen.
