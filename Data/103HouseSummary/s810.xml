Interstate Banking Act of 1993 - Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to authorize the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) to permit an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company to acquire existing out-of-State banks, whether or not the host State permits such transactions. Permits an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company to combine into a single bank its subsidiary banks which are located in more than one State. Permits a host State to levy a bank shares tax upon an out-of-State bank with branches within the host State. Subjects national or State bank branches to the regulatory scheme of the host State. Grants the States a specified period within which to elect to either permit or prohibit interstate combinations of bank holding company subsidiaries within their borders. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to authorize host State regulatory authorities to enter into cooperative agreements to coordinate their examination of out-of-State bank branches. Authorizes a State to enact laws expressly permitting adequately capitalized and adequately managed out-of-State banks to establish new branches within its borders. Amends Federal banking law to authorize the Comptroller of the Currency to approve interstate branching by a national bank if the law of the host State expressly permits such activity. Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to include within its purview evaluations of the interstate branches of regulated financial institutions. Amends Federal banking law to permit State taxing authorities to review the records of a federally chartered depository institution for State tax purposes. Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act to set as a prerequisite for interstate branching by Federal savings associations the approval of the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
