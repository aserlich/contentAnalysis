Tax Rebate to Fight Crime Act - Appropriates two percent of net Federal individual income tax revenues to the Trust Fund to Fight Crime established in each State. Allows expenditures from such trust funds for: (1) salaries and expenses of police officers; (2) building and operating prisons; and (3) salaries and expenses of judges of courts handling criminal cases, prosecutors, and public defenders. Requires rebates from such trust funds to taxpayers if amounts are not spent as required. Reduces discretionary spending limits set forth in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to reflect amounts appropriated by this Act.
