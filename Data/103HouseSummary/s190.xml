	<summary>
	1/26/1993--Introduced.
Repeals provisions of the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992 which require 20 percent income tax withholding on eligible rollover distributions of pension plans which are not rolled over into eligible retirement plans. Requires the Internal Revenue Code to be applied as if such provisions had never been enacted. Authorizes the President to offset any loss of revenues by reducing obligations and expenditures for programs, projects, and activities authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, except for allocation of funds for countries specified in law.
