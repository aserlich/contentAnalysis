	2/18/1993--Introduced.
Multilingual Radio Act - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to begin procedures to prescribe regulations to: (1) establish demonstration frequencies to provide multilingual amplitude modulation radio broadcasting services to large metropolitan areas with large multilingual populations; (2) require such demonstration frequency to be licensed in the New York City area; (3) create other demonstration frequencies, if possible, in other large metropolitan areas with large multilingual populations; (4) make such frequencies available for expanded services within a specified radio band; and (5) require the licensee of such a multilingual operation to devote a specified amount of air time per day and per week in programming other than English and a specified amount of time per day in instructional English. Directs the FCC to establish such frequencies as not-for-profit operations and award the license for such frequencies by comparative hearing to nonprofit groups with substantial experience in serving the needs of the multilingual and multiethnic communities.
