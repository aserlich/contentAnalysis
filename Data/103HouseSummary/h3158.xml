	<summary>
	9/28/1993--Introduced.
Defense Competitiveness Act of 1993 - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to permit the Export-Import Bank, for a five-year period, to finance the sale of defense articles or services to a qualified country if a U.S. company and a foreign entity are competing for the sale. (Currently, the Bank is prohibited from financing such sales.) Defines a &quot;qualified country&quot; as Japan, any member of NATO (other than the United States), and any party to the security treaty (ANZUS Pact) between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (other than the United States). Limits the amount of financing provided in any fiscal year. Repeals provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 concerning the international military education and training program.
