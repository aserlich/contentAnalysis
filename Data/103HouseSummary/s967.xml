	5/13/1993--Introduced.
Uniform Child Support Enforcement Act of 1993 - Amends the Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code to replace the current system for the collection and distribution of child support and enforcement of child support orders by the States with a new Federal system under which States are required to transmit copies of such orders to the Internal Revenue Service for it to collect the support through wage withholding and other means, distribute it to the individual entitled, and enforce support orders in a manner similar to that used for tax evasion.
