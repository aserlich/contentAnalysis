Title III: Sense of Congress Provisions - Expresses the sense of the Congress that legislation should be enacted providing enforceable limits to control the growth of entitlement or mandatory spending.

(Sec. 33) Expresses the sense of the Senate on controlling non-Social Security mandatory spending after health care reform legislation is enacted. (Sec. 34) Expresses the sense of the Congress with respect to budgetary accounting of health care reform, reimbursing State and local governments for illegal immigration costs, baseline budgeting, and the cost to State and local governments of unfunded Federal mandates. (Sec. 38) Expresses the sense of the Senate regarding closing loopholes in foreign tax provisions, creating targets for the growth in tax expenditures, and the budget authority of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. (Sec. 40) Expresses the sense of the Congress on funding health service delivery and water infrastructure in the Indian Health Service. (Sec. 42) Expresses the sense of the Senate on the minimum allocation program for Federal-aid highways. (Sec. 43) Expresses the sense of the Congress that levels of spending set forth in this resolution regarding the International Affairs budget category include an assumption that the United States will oppose attempts by the Russian Federation to intimidate, use military force, or engage in economic coercion to establish a sphere of influence over the former republics of the Soviet Union, the Baltics, or Central and Eastern European nations. (Sec. 44) Expresses the sense of the Senate on limiting ballistic missile defense (Star Wars) spending.
