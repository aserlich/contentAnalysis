Authorizes the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or his designee in a position not lower than Deputy Assistant Director to request: (1) the name, address, length of service, and toll billing records of a person or entity (person) if the Director certifies in writing to the wire or electronic communication service provider that such information is relevant to an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation and that there are specific, articulable facts giving reason to believe that the person is a foreign power or agent (current law does not specify the type of information sought or the position of the designee); and (2) the name, address, and length of service of a person if the Director certifies that the information sought is relevant to an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation and that there are specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that communication facilities registered in the name of the person have been used in communication with an individual who is or has been engaged in international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, or with a foreign power or agent concerning international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, that involve or may involve a violation of U.S. criminal statutes.
