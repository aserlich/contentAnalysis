National Highway System Designation Act of 1994 - Designates the National Highway System (HNS), as submitted by the Secretary of Transportation, within the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Authorizes the Secretary, at the request of a State, to add new NHS segments (including intermodal connections) and to delete existing route segments and connections if the total NHS miles do not exceed 165,000 miles. Requires: (1) the State to establish that the requested route changes have been indentified cooperatively with local officials through the metropolitan and statewide transportation planning processes; and (2) the Secretary to determine that the requested changes meet criteria established for, and enhance the national transportation characteristics of, the NHS.
