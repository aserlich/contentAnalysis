Lists the required services included in such coverage. Requires that such coverage continue for at least 12 months, except in certain circumstances, such as where the coverage of pregnant women must continue for one year following the end of pregnancy. Limits the size of a residential treatment facility. Allows a State agency to grant exceptions to such limit. Prohibits the facility from being licensed as a hospital. Caps the number of nationwide beds for which Federal assistance may be provided under such residential treatment programs. Increases such annual bed cap for calendar years 1994 through 1998.
