House of Representatives Reform Resolution of 1993 - Amends rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives to require the chairman of each committee to appoint members of that committee to serve as chairmen of its subcommittees. Prohibits the number of staff positions for each House committee, the number of clerk hire positions for each Member of the House, and the amount of funding for such positions in the 106th Congress and thereafter from exceeding 50 percent of the number and amount for such committee in the 103d Congress. Requires the Speaker to refer legislation initially to one committee as the committee of principal jurisdiction. (Currently, such legislation may initially be referred simultaneously to two or more committees for concurrent or sequential consideration.) Prohibits a Member from serving on a committee as a member for more than eight years or as its chairman for more than four years. Amends rule XIV to prohibit the Speaker from recognizing any Member for the purpose of making a special-order or one-minute speech. Amends rule XXXIV to prohibit extensions of remarks by Members from being inserted in the Congressional Record unless they pertain to legislative matters before the House, its committees, or subcommittees. Declares that it is the policy of the House of Representatives that the following Federal laws should be amended to apply to the House in the same or similar manner as they apply to the executive branch: (1) the National Labor Relations Act; (2) the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970; (3) the Equal Pay Act of 1963; (4) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; (5) the Freedom of Information Act; (6) the Privacy Act of 1974; and (7) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Directs the standing committees of the House with subject jurisdiction over such Federal laws to report legislation to the House to implement such policy.
