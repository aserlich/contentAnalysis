	<summary>
	4/2/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Federal criminal code to require, as a condition of probation, supervised release, or parole, that the defendant pass a drug test, refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance, and submit to at least two periodic drug tests (as determined by the court) for use of a controlled substance. Specifies that no action may be taken against a defendant pursuant to such a drug test unless it is a urine drug test confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques or a test the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts determines to be of equivalent accuracy. Directs the court to consider the availability of appropriate substance abuse treatment programs when considering action against a defendant or parolee who fails a drug test.
