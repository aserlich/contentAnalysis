	11/19/1993--House agreed to Senate amendment with amendment. Patent and Trademark Office Authorization Act of 1993 - Authorizes appropriations to the Patent and Trademark Office for FY 1994. Sets the trademark fee at $245 and prohibits any adjustments to such fee before October 1, 1994. Amends the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 to authorize the owner of record of the patent or its agent to submit an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks for an interim extension of such patent if the owner or agent expects that the regulatory review period that began for the product involved may extend beyond such expiration. Directs the Commissioner to issue to the applicant a certificate of interim extension for a maximum one-year period, subject to specified conditions. Limits an applicant to four subsequent interim extensions and to one extension in some cases. Requires applications for such extensions to be made during the period beginning 60 days before, and ending 30 days before, the expiration of the preceding interim extension. Terminates such interim extension at the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the product involved receives permission for commercial marketing or use, unless within such period, the applicant notifies the Commissioner of such permission and submits any additional information not previously contained in the interim extension application. Extends such patent for at least five years from the date of the expiration of the original patent term or, in certain circumstances, from the date on which the product involved receives approval for commercial marketing or use. Limits the rights derived from the extended patents during the period of interim extension in the case of a patent which claims a: (1) product, to any use then under regulatory review; (2) method of using a product, to any use claimed by the patent then under regulatory review; and (3) method of manufacturing a product, to the method of manufacturing as used to make the product then under regulatory review. Extends the terms of certain patents for the badges of the American Legion, the American Legion Women's Auxiliary, and the Sons of the American Legion.
