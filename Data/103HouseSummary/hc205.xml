	2/10/1994--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development should: (1) allow census block group data to be used in the same manner as census tract data in determining whether areas are eligible for designation as empowerment zones and enterprise communities authorized by the Internal Revenue Code; and (2) treat census tracts or blocks that have no population, or (if more than 75 percent of the tract or block is zoned for commercial or industrial use) have populations of less than 2,000, as counting towards all poverty rate requirements for designation of such zones and communities.
