	6/30/1994--Introduced.
Provides that it shall not be a violation of Federal criminal law regarding the destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities for authorized employees or agents of: (1) a foreign country to damage or destroy an aircraft in that country's territory or airspace if the aircraft is suspected of being engaged in the trafficking of controlled substances and the President determines that such actions are necessary because of the threat posed by such trafficking to the country's national security and the country has appropriate procedures to protect against the innocent loss of life; or (2) the United States to provide assistance for such actions. Requires the Secretary of State to report to specified congressional committees on: (1) the effectiveness of the U.S. policy of sharing information produced by U.S. radar installations and military aircraft with governments in South America for purposes of identifying and disrupting controlled substances trafficking activities; and (2) any adverse implications that such policy may have on U.S. national security interests.
