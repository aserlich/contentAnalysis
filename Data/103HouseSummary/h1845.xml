Requires NBS to notify specified State and county committees of intended entry on non-Federal property over which they maintain agricultural-related responsibilities. (Sec. 7) Defines &quot;biological resources&quot; to mean plants, fish, invertebrates, and wildlife. (Sec. 9) Authorizes FY 1994 and 1995 appropriations. (Sec. 10) Provides for compliance with the Buy American Act. Prohibits contracts with an entity that has made fraudulent use of &quot;Made in America&quot; labels.
