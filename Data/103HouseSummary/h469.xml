	<summary>
	1/6/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Secretary of Transportation not to give consideration to the availability of slots (a reservation for an instrument flight rule takeoff or landing of an aircraft) at high density airports in determining the provision of basic essential air service to small communities and selecting an air carrier to provide such service. Requires the Secretary to ensure that a sufficient number of such slots are available to the air carrier providing such service at such airports, except at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, if the number of slots to and from such airport is at least 132. Provides for the transfer of slots at such airports.
