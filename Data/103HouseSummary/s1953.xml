	<summary>
	3/21/1994--Introduced.
Amends the Flood Control Act of 1968 to: (1) allow user fees at U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) lakes and reservoirs to be collected only from users of highly developed facilities requiring continuous maintenance and supervision; and (2) prohibit the collection of such fees for access to or use of water areas, undeveloped or lightly developed shoreland, and related areas where no mechanical or hydraulic equipment is provided. Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to require the Corps, at Corps lakes and reservoirs where camping is permitted, to provide at least one primitive campground where no charge is imposed.
