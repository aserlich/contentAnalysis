	<summary>
	1/5/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to: (1) repeal the current licensing requirements for exports of dual use items to countries whose governments support international terrorism; and (2) prohibit such exports outright. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition if: (1) the export transaction is determined essential to U.S. national security interests; and (2) the President consults with specified congressional committees about the proposed transaction and submits the reason for such waiver to the Congress in writing. Requires denial of a license to export any chemical or biological weapons if the ultimate consignee is a country whose government has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism. Requires the President to report annually to the Congress on all visits to the United States by any official of any such government.
