	<summary>
	4/1/1993--Introduced.
Declares that the President should enter into revised host-nation agreements with the European member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) under which such nations agree that, for FY 1995 and thereafter, these nations will: (1) pay at least 50 percent of the personnel costs, and 75 percent of the nonpersonnel costs, of maintaining U.S. military personnel and installations in Europe; (2) relieve the U.S. armed forces of all tax liability that is incurred under the laws of the NATO member nation and community where such forces are located; and (3) ensure that goods and services furnished in these nations to U.S. armed forces are provided at minimum cost and without the imposition of user fees. Prohibits the use of appropriated funds to maintain U.S. military personnel and installations in such nations after FY 1995 unless the President certifies to the Congress that they have entered into revised agreements. Makes this Act inapplicable if the U.S. armed forces are actively engaged in armed conflict in Europe or the threat of imminent U.S. engagement in conflict in Europe exists.
