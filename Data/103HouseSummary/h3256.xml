	10/12/1993--Introduced.
Child Protection Act of 1993 - Requires each State to: (1) establish and maintain a program requiring persons convicted of a sex offense against a child victim to register a current address and other information deemed relevant by the Attorney General with a designated State law enforcement agency for 20 years after being released from prison or otherwise being freed from detention after the conviction becomes final; and (2) permit members of the public to inquire whether any registered offenders live in their vicinity and whether a named individual is so registered. Directs the Attorney General to establish guidelines for State registration programs, which shall include: (1) a requirement that the State obtain the fingerprints, physical description, and current photographs of each registered person; (2) annual updating of the registry information by each registered person; (3) criminal penalties for failing to comply with the registration requirements; and (4) a toll-free telephone number through which residents of the State may make inquiries. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) State reporting requirements (and requires the Attorney General to publish an annual summary of convictions for sex offenses involving children, based on reported information); and (2) sanctions for noncompliance by a State. Requires: (1) a State to permit qualified entities to obtain from an authorized State agency a nationwide background check for the purpose of determining whether there is a report that a provider has been convicted of a background check crime; and (2) the Attorney General to provide to authorized State agencies information possessed by the Department of Justice that would enable the agency to make a background check (but assuring the currency and accuracy of the information and that the States maintain procedures to permit providers to check and correct information relating to them).
