	<summary>
	5/26/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 and Federal veterans' benefits provisions to: (1) extend through December 31, 1998, the authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide sexual trauma counseling at Department facilities as well as through non-Department providers; (2) remove a requirement that veterans seek such counseling within a specified period after discharge; (3) remove the current one-year limit on the length of such counseling; (4) make the provision of such counseling equal in priority to the provision of Department outpatient services; (5) authorize the Department to provide such counseling to all veterans (currently, only women); and (6) require (current law authorizes) the provision of a 24-hour toll-free telephone number for the provision of sexual trauma crisis counseling. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make certain reports with respect to: (1) the operation of the telephone hotline; and (2) the difficulties veterans encounter in obtaining from the Department determinations that disabilities relating to sexual trauma are service-connected. Modifies responsibilities of Department coordinators of women's services. Requires the Secretary to ensure that such coordinators are provided sufficient resources to carry out such responsibilities.
