Prohibits the President from recommending for a 12-month period in 1994 continuation of a waiver of human rights and emigration requirements for nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) for China under the Trade Act of 1974 unless the President reports to the Congress that China has ceased manipulating its currency's rate of exchange to prevent balance of payment adjustments or to gain an unfair competitive advantage in trade with the United States.
