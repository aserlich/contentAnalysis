Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the people of the United States deserve a full accounting of the radiation experiments conducted by the Government; (2) the Secretary of Energy should be commended for quickly responding to the disclosures that such experiments had been conducted on individuals without their consent by promising to locate and release all relevant records and the President should be commended for establishing a Human Radiation Interagency Working group and an independent Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments; (3) all Federal departments and agencies should act expeditiously to locate, retrieve, and inventory all records and documents related to the experiments which should be made available to the subjects and their families; (4) the subjects who are still alive should receive appropriate followup medical care; (5) the President should consider whether compensation should be provided to such individuals or their survivors; and (6) an apology should be made by the Government to the individuals and their families.
