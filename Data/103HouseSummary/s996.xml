Requires educational organizations that offer educational programs to minors for a fee to disclose certain information in written form to the minor or the minor's parent before accepting funds for the cost of the minor's participation in such a program. (Excludes from the definition of educational organization a local educational agency, an elementary or secondary school or organization sponsored by such a school, a recreational organization, or a social club.) Requires each such educational organization to include a verifiable statement of nondiscriminatory enrollment and employment policy on all enrollment or recruitment material. Directs the Secretary of Education to monitor compliance with this Act. Authorizes imposition of civil fines for violations.
