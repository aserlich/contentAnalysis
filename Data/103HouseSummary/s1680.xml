	<summary>
	11/18/1993--Introduced.
Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993 - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to require the responsible entity for each public facility to adopt a uniform indoor air policy that meets the requirements of this Act. Defines a &quot;public facility&quot; as a building regularly entered by ten or more individuals at least one day per week, including a building owned by or leased to a Federal, State, or local governmental entity and excluding a building regularly used for residential purposes. Requires such policy to: (1) prohibit the emission of environmental tobacco smoke within the facility and on facility property within the immediate vicinity of the facility's entrance; and (2) provide for the posting of a notice of such prohibition in visible locations at the facility. Permits such policy to provide an exception to the prohibition for specially designated smoking areas within a facility if: (1) the areas are ventilated to ensure that air is directly exhausted to the outside and does not recirculate or drift to other areas within the facility; and (2) nonsmoking individuals do not have to enter such areas for any purpose. Authorizes waivers from compliance with this Act if a facility is subject to unusual and extenuating circumstances. Limits waivers to one-year periods. Prescribes civil penalties for violations of this Act.
