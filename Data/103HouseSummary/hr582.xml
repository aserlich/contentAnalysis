	10/7/1994--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) a continued Federal commitment to the railroad retirement system is essential to assure the integrity of railroad retirees' benefits; and (2) the National Performance Review's proposal to dismantle and transfer the administrative functions of the railroad retirement system to other Federal agencies and eliminate the Railroad Retirement Board should be rejected.
