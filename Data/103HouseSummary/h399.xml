Child Care Tax Credit Reform Act of 1993 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the amount of employment-related expenses subject to the dependent care income tax credit. Denies the credit to taxpayers having adjusted gross income of $50,000 or more. Removes the 20 percent minimum credit percentage, thus subjecting taxpayers having income above $28,000 to an incremental decrease in the applicable credit percentage.
