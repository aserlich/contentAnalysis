	6/30/1993--Introduced.
Civilian Facilities Closure and Realignment Act of 1993 - Establishes the Civilian Facilities Closure and Realignment Commission. Requires the heads of executive agencies (except for the Secretary of Defense) to submit recommendations for closing or realigning civilian facilities to the Commission. Directs the Office of Management and Budget to submit estimates of the administrative costs and savings that would result from the implementation of such recommendations to the Commission. Requires the Commission to report its recommendations for closures and realignments of Federal facilities and proposed legislation to the President. Provides for presidential approval of the report. Sets forth procedures for congressional consideration of the proposed legislation. Requires proceeds from the sale of any agency's assets resulting from closures or realignments to be applied to reduce the Federal deficit and deposited in the Treasury and treated as general receipts. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) in the fiscal year immediately following the submission of an agency's recommendation, there should be appropriated to each agency at least 25 percent of the amount of estimated administrative savings applicable to such agency in the three fiscal years following such submission; and (2) the appropriated amount should be in addition to funds which would otherwise be appropriated if not for this Act and made available for expenditure to improve the agency's management, efficiency, or productivity. Authorizes appropriations.
