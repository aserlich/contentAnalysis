Provides for: (1) maximum lifetime benefits after which policyholders may become eligible for assistance under the State plan above; and (2) portability in the case of qualified policies which are group policies. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) provide that individuals eligible for services under SSA title XIX (Medicaid) which, effective upon the enactment of this Act, are provided under the new Federal program above shall continue to be eligible to receive such services in the same manner as previously provided; (2) establish, in collaboration with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and report to the Congress on, a system for collecting data on public and private long-term care services for making certain service-related predictions; (3) establish a new organizational unit to administer the new Federal program established above; and (4) submit to appropriate congressional committees a legislative proposal for such amendments as are required by this Act. (Sec. 103) Amends Medicaid to repeal provisions concerning home and community care for functionally disabled elderly individuals. (Sec. 104) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to the Congress on the appropriateness and adequacy of using the Federal medical assistance percentage used under Medicaid for payment of services provided under such new program. Title II: Long-Term Care Tax Provisions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow an individual an itemized deduction for qualified long-term care services; (2) provide for the treatment of long-term care insurance or plans; (3) set forth specified consumer protection provisions to be satisfied by qualified long-term care insurance contracts, including the NAIC model Act; and (4) impose an excise tax on persons for failing to meet specified requirements for long-term care insurance policies, including certain requirements of the model Act and regulation and those involving disclosure.
