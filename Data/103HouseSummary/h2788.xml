	7/28/1993--Introduced.
Self-Sufficiency Standard Act - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to establish economic self-sufficiency standards for disadvantaged adult training programs, according to a formula to be developed by the Secretary of Labor and local economic self-sufficiency tables to be developed by service delivery areas. Prohibits incentive grants to service delivery areas that do not have in effect, after two years, an approved local economic self-sufficiency standards table. Requires inclusion of such a table and related reports in the job training plan and in the Governor's coordination and special services plan. Directs the Secretary to make up to six grants in each of three fiscal years to States for demonstration and exemplary programs to increase the number of participants in disadvantaged adult training programs who are trained and placed in jobs that yield long-term economic self-sufficiency in accordance with the local economic self-sufficiency tables.
