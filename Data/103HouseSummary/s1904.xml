	6/13/1994--Passed House amended. Board of Veterans' Appeals Administrative Procedures Improvement Act of 1994 - Amends Federal law pertaining to the Board of Veterans' Appeals to: (1) remove the 65-person limitation for the Board; (2) subject the Chairman of the Board to the same limitations and restrictions concerning involvement in political activities as currently apply to judges of the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals; (3) allow the Chairman to designate employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs to serve as acting members of the Board for up to 90 days (with other limitations); and (4) include information concerning such acting members and the number of cases they handled in a required report on Board activities. Allows proceedings assigned to the Board to be assigned to an individual member or a three-member panel for decision. (Current law requires such decisions by a minimum three-member panel.) Sets forth revised provisions relating to: (1) decision reconsideration as ordered by the Chairman; (2) the correction of obvious errors upon Board motion; and (3) appeals procedures. Allows (current law requires) the Secretary to require a parents' dependency and indemnity compensation recipient or applicant to file an annual income statement. Requires the applicant to notify the Secretary (current law requires a revised report) when there is a material change in the applicant's estimated income for that year. Makes identical changes with respect to a recipient or applicant for veterans' pension benefits.
