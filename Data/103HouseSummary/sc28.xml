	5/28/1993--Introduced.
Commends Syria and Lebanon for participation in the Middle East peace process and encourages their continued cooperation in efforts to settle ongoing regional conflicts. Expresses congressional support for the sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity of Lebanon. Considers the Government of Syria in violation of the Taif Agreement of 1989 (calling for Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon). Urges: (1) Syria to withdraw its armed forces to the gateway of the Bekaa Valley; (2) Syria and Lebanon to agree upon a firm timetable for the complete withdrawal of Syrian forces; (3) the President to consider withholding U.S. assistance to Syria and the Secretary of the Treasury to consider directing the U.S. executive directors of all international financial institutions to vote against loans or assistance to Syria until such withdrawal occurs; (4) the Syrian Government to increase its cooperation with the Lebanese Government in efforts to disarm nongovernmental armed groups and militias in Lebanon; and (5) the President to consider methods of revitalizing the Taif Agreement and to encourage the negotiation of a firm timetable for complete withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon.
