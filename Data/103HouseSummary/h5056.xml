	9/19/1994--Introduced.
Animal Drug Amendments of 1994 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to permit the extra-label use of drugs in animals if an approval of an application is in effect with respect to a particular use or intended use of a new animal drug and such use is upon the order of a licensed veterinarian within the context of a veterinarian-client-patient relationship and is in compliance with regulations that establish the conditions for such use. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, if the Secretary finds that there is a reasonable probability that such use may present a risk to the public health, to establish a safe level for a residue of an animal drug when used for such different use and require the development of a practical, analytical method for the detection of residues of the drug above the safe level established. Prohibits such use if it results in residues exceeding the safe level.
