	8/2/1993--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency should formulate an arms security policy for the United States that: (1) is consistent with the legal commitment of the United States to general and complete disarmament of conventional and nonconventional weapons and related technology; (2) will serve as the basis for entering into multilateral negotiations to conclude treaties and agreements relating to general and complete disarmament; and (3) gives the highest priority to developing effective mechanisms for the non-violent resolution of disputes relating to such weapons and technology as an alternative to war.
