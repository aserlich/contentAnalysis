	11/18/1993--Introduced.
Antarctic Environmental Protection Act of 1993 - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to provide legislative authority to implement the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. (Sec. 4) Makes it unlawful for any person to: (1) engage in or provide assistance to any Antarctic mineral resource activity; (2) receive, transport, offer for sale, sell, purchase, import, or export, or have custody or control of any Antarctic mineral resource which that person should have known was recovered as a result of Antarctic mineral resource activity; (3) introduce any prohibited product onto land or ice shelves or into water in Antarctica; (4) dispose of any waste onto ice-free land areas or into fresh water systems in Antarctica; (5) dispose of any prohibited waste in Antarctica; (6) engage in open burning of waste in Antarctica after March 1, 1994; (7) transport passengers to, from, or within Antarctica by any vessel not required to comply with the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships unless the person has an agreement under which the vessel owner or operator is required to comply with Annex IV to the Protocol; (8) fail to notify all members of the environmental protection obligations of this Act if organizing, sponsoring, operating, or promoting a nongovernmental expedition to Antarctica; (9) damage or remove a historic site or monument; (10) refuse permission to any authorized U.S. employee to board a U.S. vessel, vehicle, or aircraft (or one subject to U.S. jurisdiction) for purposes of searches or inspections in connection with this Act's enforcement, interfere in such searches or inspections, or resist or interfere with a lawful arrest or detention for any prohibited act; or (11) violate any regulation or permit term under this Act or attempt to commit any prohibited act. Makes it unlawful, unless authorized by a permit, to: (1) dispose of any waste in Antarctica, except as authorized under the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships; (2) introduce into Antarctica any member of a non-native species; (3) enter or engage in activities within any Antarctica specially protected area; (4) engage in any taking or harmful interference in Antarctica; or (5) receive, transport, offer for sale, sell, purchase, import, export or have custody or control of any native bird, mammal, or plant which the person should have known was taken in violation of this Act. Makes exceptions to specified prohibited acts in emergency circumstances. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Director of the National Science Foundation to issue permits for specified activities and to establish application fees. Lists conditions for certain activities and requirements for regulations to implement the Protocol. (Sec. 7) Applies environmental impact assessment requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act to proposals for Federal agency activities occurring and affecting the quality of the environment in Antarctica. Permits activities determined to have less than a minor or transitory impact on the environment to proceed under specified conditions. Makes environmental impact assessment requirements inapplicable in the case of activities carried out jointly with other governments if the Secretary of State determines that another party to the Protocol is coordinating environmental impact assessment procedures. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate regulations to provide for the environmental impact assessment of nongovernmental activities. (Sec. 9) Amends the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships to apply Annex IV of the Protocol to all vessels over which the United States has jurisdiction, except for warships, naval auxiliary, or other ships owned or operated by the United States when engaged in noncommercial service or other ships specifically excluded by the MARPOL Protocol. (Sec. 10) Requires the Secretary to designate a U.S. officer or employee to be the U.S. representative to the Committee for Environmental Protection under the Protocol. (Sec. 11) Directs the Secretary to conduct inspections at intervals between two and five years of the U.S. Antarctic Program. Requires the inspection team to report on the compliance of the Program with this Act and the Protocol. (Sec. 12) Directs the Department of State to coordinate an interagency study of tourism in Antarctica to determine whether additional measures should be taken with respect to Antarctic tourist activities. (Sec. 14) Sets forth provisions concerning judicial review of regulations and citizen suits. (Sec. 15) Establishes enforcement and penalty procedures. (Sec. 23) Provides that this Act shall prevail over any inconsistent provision of the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act. Repeals the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978 and the Antarctic Protection Act of 1990. Authorizes appropriations.
