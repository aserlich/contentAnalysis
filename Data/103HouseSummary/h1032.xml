	<summary>
	4/27/1993--Passed House amended. Department of Veterans Affairs Employment Discrimination Act - Requires consideration under procedures applicable to the Merit Systems Protection Board of any allegation by an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs of unlawful employment discrimination if the action (or failure to act) of which the employee complains is an employment action or practice otherwise appealable to such Board. Establishes in the Department an Office of Employment Discrimination Complaints Resolution headed by a Director who shall administer Department procedures for resolving complaints of unlawful employment discrimination. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to include certain information with respect to Office budgets and activities in annual budget documents submitted to the Congress. Directs Office employees to counsel and resolve the complaints of Department employees in an expeditious and informal manner through informal investigation and conciliation. Outlines procedures for: (1) the investigation of complaints through either informal resolution or assignment to an administrative law judge; (2) a hearing and final agency decision by such a judge for cases unresolved through the informal process; and (3) review of final agency decisions by either the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the appropriate U.S. district court. Provides protection of Department employees under appropriate Federal whistleblower protection provisions.
