	<summary>
	6/8/1994--Introduced.
Authorizes and directs the Secretary of Defense to transfer on a nonreimbursable basis any excess industrial property to any nonprofit educational institution or training school when such entity's proposed use of such property will contribute materially to the national defense. Deems property loaned to such entities before September 30, 1993, to be surplus property, unless the Secretary determines such property is needed by the Department of Defense. Authorizes the Administrator of General Services to convey the property to such entities upon certification that such property use is consistent with the purpose for which it was loaned.
