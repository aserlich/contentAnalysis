	8/24/1994--Introduced.
Emergency Spending Control Act of 1994 - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to limit emergency appropriations and legislation to the matter of emergency. Allows such a statute to contain rescissions of budget authority. Makes it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill or joint resolution containing an emergency designation if the legislation provides an appropriation for any other item or matter.
