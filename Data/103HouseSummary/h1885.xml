TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Reducing the Cost of Capital By Reducing Capital Gains Tax Rates and Indexing the Basis of Certain Assets Title II: Adjusting Depreciation Rates to Reflect Inflation Title III: Expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts Title IV: Two Percent Cap on Increases in All Federal Spending Through 1998 Title V: Reduction in Unnecessary and Burdensome Regulations Private Sector Job Creation and Economic Growth Act - Title I: Reducing the Cost of Capital by Reducing Capital Gains Tax Rates and Indexing the Basis of Certain Assets - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the individual and corporate capital gains rate to 15 percent. Reduces such tax to 7.5 percent for low- and middle-income taxpayers. Provides for the phaseout of personal exemptions and the overall limitation on itemized deductions to take into account adjusted gross income which has been reduced by net capital gain. Requires indexing, based on the gross national product deflator, of the adjusted basis of certain assets (corporate stock and tangible property that is a capital asset of property used in a trade or business) that have been held for more than one year at the time of sale or other transfer, solely for the purpose of determining gain or loss. Provides for indexing the limitation on capital losses of noncorporate taxpayers. Title II: Adjusting Depreciation Rates to Reflect Inflation - Provides a depreciation deduction adjustment for tangible property (other than residential rental property and nonresidential real property) placed in service after 1993. Allows phase-in deductions for such property placed in service after 1999. Title III: Expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts - Removes limitations on the deductibility of contributions to individual retirement plans (IRAs) by active participants in employer-maintained plans, thereby restoring the IRA deduction. Increases the maximum IRA deduction and provides an inflation adjustment. Provides exemptions from the ten-percent penalty on early withdrawals from individual retirement plans for: (1) first home purchases; (2) higher education expenses; and (3) financially devastating medical expenses. Title IV: Two Percent Cap on Increases in All Federal Spending Through 1998 - Establishes the budget for FY 1994 and sets forth appropriate budgetary levels for FY 1995 through 1998. Sets forth recommended budgetary levels of Federal revenues, new budget authority, budget outlays, deficits, public debt, and credit activity, including funding for each major functional category. Requires the House Budget Committee to report a reconciliation bill or resolution or both carrying out all recommendations of House committees concerning changes in laws to provide spending sufficient to reduce outlays and reduce the deficit. Title V: Reduction in Unnecessary and Burdensome Regulations - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should extend for one year the 90-day moratorium on new unnecessary Federal regulations ordered in the President's Memorandum on Reducing the Burden of Government Regulations, dated January 28, 1992. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to include an estimate of the economic costs to the Government and private sector within analyses of public bills and resolutions. Amends the Government Organization and Employees Act to require the preparation of an economic impact statement in conjunction with the general notice of any proposed rulemaking or where a proposed rule is likely to have exceptional fiscal consequences for a particular region or level of government.
