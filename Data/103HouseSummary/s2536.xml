	10/7/1994--Introduced.
Charitable Medical Care Act of 1994 - Exempts health care professionals from liability for negligence in the provision of health care services without charge, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Makes this Act applicable only if such professional, before furnishing the service: (1) agrees to furnish such service voluntarily and without charge to the recipient or to any health insurance plan or program under which the recipient is covered; and (2) provides the recipient with adequate notice, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, of the professional's limited liability for that service. Preempts any inconsistent State law. Specifies that this Act shall not preempt any State law that provides greater incentives or protections to a health care professional rendering such service.
