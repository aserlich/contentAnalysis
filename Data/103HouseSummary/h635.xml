	1/26/1993--Introduced.
Repeals the social security offset applicable to certain annuities paid to surviving spouses under the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) for retired members of the armed forces, to the extent that such offset is due to social security benefits which are based on the surviving spouse's own earnings or self-employment. Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to recompute the existing annuities of certain individuals currently under the SBP or who have become eligible for such annuity by the date of enactment of this Act, in order to determine if such recomputation is more favorable due to changes made by this Act.
