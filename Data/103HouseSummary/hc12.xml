	1/5/1993--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Constitution does not preclude periods of silence in public schools to be used at the discretion of the individual for prayer or introspection, even if these moments are supervised by a school official; and (2) public school authorities should recognize the historic importance of religion to our civilization by encouraging such periods of silence.
