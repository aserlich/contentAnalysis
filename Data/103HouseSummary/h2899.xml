	8/5/1993--Introduced.
Violent and Repeat Offender Accountability Act of 1993 - Requires each State, to be eligible for funds under this Act, to conduct and report to the Attorney General on a systematic review of its criminal sentencing laws and practices, including analyses related to: (1) the State statutory criminal sentencing scheme; (2) sentences actually imposed for specified crimes; (3) time actually served; (4) practices and procedures relating to probation, parole, and other alternatives to incarceration; (5) restitution; (6) pretrial detention; (7) victims rights; (8) post-conviction relief procedures; (9) application of adult sentencing laws to juvenile offenders; and (10) prison capacity. Directs each State to submit to the Attorney General for approval a plan that evaluates the criminal sentencing system and, if necessary, creates a sentencing system which provides for: (1) State constitutional or statutory authority for pretrial detention of dangerous criminals; (2) mandatory minimum prison sentences which do not allow probation or suspension of sentence, for certain violent or repeat offenders; (3) mandatory life sentence with no release for a third or subsequent conviction of a violent crime; (4) provisions which restrict parole, good-time credit release for violent offenders, or other early release to not more than a total reduction of 15 percent of the sentence imposed; and (5) State constitutional or statutory provisions which guarantee victims the right to be informed, present, and heard at all critical stages of the criminal case, and to ensure the collection, tracking, and enforcement of restitution from the offender in all cases involving economic loss to the victim. Makes funds available for this Act from amounts appropriated for foreign operations, for trade promotion, travel, and tourism activities, and for Federal land purchases. Limits the Federal share of grants made under this Act to 50 percent of total project costs.
