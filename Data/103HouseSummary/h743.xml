	2/2/1993--Introduced.
National Park Revitalization Act - Amends the National Park Service Concessions Policy Act (the Act) to limit the period of a concession contract in a National Park System unit to ten years to a maximum of 15 years if the Secretary of the Interior finds that a longer period is necessary for the acquisition of possessory interest. Sets forth certain requirements of such contracts. Repeals provisions of the Act to release the United States from any obligation to compensate concessioners for loss of specified investments. Provides that franchise fees shall be based on annual gross receipts from the concession and shall not be less than a specified percentage of such receipts. Makes the concessioner responsible for all utility costs incurred in the operation of the concession under such contracts. Amends Federal law to prohibit the Secretary from reimbursing concessioners for utility services in the National Park System. Prohibits the Secretary from granting preferential rights to concessioners with respect to additional contracts, and renewal of contracts or permits. Vests in the United States all right, title, and interest to any structure, fixture, or improvement acquired or constructed on federally-owned land within an area administered by the National Park Service. Directs the Secretary to acquire any possessory interest relating to concession contracts established before the enactment of this Act. Prohibits the Secretary from approving the direct or indirect transfer of the possessory interest to a contract subject to this Act, with exceptions. Requires that a record of each audit under the Act be available to the public in a way that prevents revealing trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Specifies allocations, at the end of a fiscal year, of such franchise fees deposited into a special account established in the Treasury, during that year.
