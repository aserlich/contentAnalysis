	3/23/1993--Introduced.
Multistate Utility Company Consumer Protection Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal Power Act to transfer from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), for purposes of determining a just and reasonable rate for consumers, the power to review and disallow the costs associated with transactions of a public utility holding company with an affiliated company. Transfers to FERC all functions of the SEC under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Amends the PUHCA to require that contracts with associates, entered into by holding company subsidiaries or mutual service companies, be performed for the benefit of such associate companies at a price not to exceed cost (currently, at cost). Conditions FERC approval of a mutual service company upon finding that it is organized to reasonably insure performance of contracts for member companies at such a price. (Thus allowing prices below cost.)
