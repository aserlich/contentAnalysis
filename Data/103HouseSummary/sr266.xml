	9/21/1994--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should: (1) not commit forces to combat in future conflicts unless it is vital to our national interest; (2) after determining that the introduction of combat troops is an absolute necessity, commit troops wholeheartedly and with the clear intention of winning; (3) have clearly defined political and military objectives for committing forces and know precisely how U.S. forces will accomplish such objectives; (4) continually reassess and readjust, if necessary, the relationship between U.S. objectives and the U.S. forces that have been committed; (5) commit no forces without the reasonable assurance that the American people and the Congress support the action; and (6) only commit forces to combat as a last resort.
