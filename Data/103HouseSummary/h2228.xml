	<summary>
	5/20/1993--Introduced.
Family Living Wage Act - Amends Internal Revenue Code provisions governing the earned income tax credit to: (1) increase from $5,714 to $8,000 the amount of earned income subject to the credit; (2) establish the basic credit at 20 percent; and (3) permit an additional credit (to apply to not more than four children) of five percent for each dependent school age child between age six and age 16 and ten percent for each preschool age child. Reduces the amount of the credit for taxpayers with adjusted gross income over $50,000. Indexes amounts relating to the credit beginning in 1995. Disallows application of the nonrefundable dependent care income tax credit with respect to a taxpayer's dependents under age 13, unless the child is physically or mentally incapable of self-care. Permits the credit with respect to handicapped children under age 16 only if the taxpayer elects not to include the child within the framework of the earned income credit. Repeals provisions of the Family Support Act of 1988 that revise the way in which the earned income credit is treated in the context of needs analysis for purposes of State plans for aid and services to needy families with children under title IV of the Social Security Act.
