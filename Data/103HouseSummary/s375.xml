	<summary>
	3/15/1994--Passed House amended. Rio Grande Designation Act of 1994 - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate one segment of the Rio Grande, New Mexico, as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System and another for potential addition to the System. Requires the study of the latter segment to be completed within three years after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, to: (1) take appropriate steps to obtain the views of the residents of the village of Pilar and of owners of property adjoining the segments described in this Act; and (2) assure that those views will be considered in connection with preparation of a comprehensive management plan for and study of such segments. Withdraws the Orilla Verde Recreation Area, New Mexico, from U.S. public land, mining, mineral, and geothermal leasing laws. Authorizes the Secretary to contract with the Smithsonian Institution for the completion of the prehistoric trackways study in New Mexico as required under current law.
