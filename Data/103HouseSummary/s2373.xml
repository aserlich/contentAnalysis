Title VII: Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships Amendments - Amends the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships to authorize the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue a certificate attesting to the adequacy of garbage reception facilities at a port or terminal only if an inspection has been conducted prior to the issuance of a certificate. (Sec. 702) Makes such certificates valid for a period of five years unless there is a change of operator. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations that require the operators of ports or terminals subject to MARPOL Protocol (the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, 1973) requirements relating to reception facilities to post placards stating that users should report facility inadequacies to the Secretary.
