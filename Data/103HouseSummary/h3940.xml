	3/2/1994--Introduced.
Polly Klaas Child Rescue Act of 1994 - Authorizes appropriations for each fiscal year beginning with FY 1995 in an amount equal to two percent of the funding for official mail costs of the House of Representatives for FY 1994 adjusted for any increase in first-class postage rates, to be used for payment of first-class postage for mailing of information on active investigations of children abducted by strangers. Authorizes the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to use the funds to pay the Postal Service for postage to be used by: (1) any local entity engaged in the search for a child abducted by a stranger; or (2) if no such entity exists, the FBI. Prohibits the funds from being used unless the FBI determines that: (1) a stranger abduction has occurred; (2) such abduction occurred not more than one year before the date of the determination; (3) the mailing will benefit the investigation; (4) an accurate and appropriate mailing list is available for the mailing; and (5) funds are not immediately available and a delay in the mailing would be harmful to the investigation. Limits the amount that may be spent on mailings to $15,000 per abducted child. Allows two percent of the funding for official mail costs of the House for FY 1994 to be made available for FY 1994 to the FBI for purposes of this Act. Provides that, if the amount appropriated pursuant to the authorization in this Act for any fiscal year beginning with FY 1995 is less than the authorized amount, the difference may be paid from the funding for official mail costs of the House for the fiscal year involved. Requires the FBI to immediately transfer the necessary funds for mailing to the Postal Service after making the required determination and the Postal Service to expedite the mailing upon receiving such funds.
