	1/21/1993--Introduced.
Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act - Prohibits the use of Federal funds to perform, promote, or do research on any procedure to take the life of an unborn child (except for medical procedures required to prevent the death of either the pregnant woman or her unborn child). Prohibits the Federal Government from entering into any contract for insurance which provides for payment or reimbursement for abortion services. States that no institution receiving Federal financial assistance shall: (1) discriminate against any employee, applicant, or student on the basis of that person's opposition to abortion; or (2) require any employee or student to participate in abortion procedures. States that attorney's fees shall not be allowed in any civil action involving a law prohibiting or restricting abortions. Provides for Supreme Court review of lower court decisions which declare State and local anti-abortion statutes unconstitutional.
