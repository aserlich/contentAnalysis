	<summary>
	9/30/1994--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the changes to the political relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States described in the commonwealth option of the Puerto Rico plebiscite of November 14, 1993, would provide to U.S. citizens who are residents of Puerto Rico the Federal benefits of U.S. citizens living in the States without the concomitant responsibilities; (2) the commonwealth formula presented in such plebiscite is not an economically or politically viable alternative to the current self-governing, unincorporated territorial status of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and (3) the unalterable bilateral pact that such formula purposes as the vehicle for the permanent union of Puerto Rico with the United States is not a constitutionally viable alternative to the current status of that Commonwealth.
