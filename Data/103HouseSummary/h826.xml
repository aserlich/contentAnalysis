	<summary>
	5/25/1993--Passed House amended. Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 - Amends Federal law to require the head of each agency to submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congress a strategic plan for performance goals of program activities. Requires the inclusion of performance plans in the President's budget. Directs the Director to require each agency to submit annual performance plans covering each program activity set forth in the agency's budget. Requires the head of each agency to submit to the President and the Congress a report on program performance for the previous fiscal year. Authorizes the Director to exempt any agency with annual outlays of $20 million or less from strategic and performance plan reporting requirements. Allows performance plans to include proposals to waive administrative procedural requirements and controls in return for specific individual or organization accountability to achieve a performance goal. Outlines proposal requirements. Requires the Director to designate: (1) not fewer than ten agencies (representing a range of Government functions) as pilot projects in performance measurement; (2) not fewer than five agencies (selected from agencies in performance measurement pilot projects) as pilot projects in managerial accountability and flexibility; and (3) not fewer than five agencies (selected from agencies in performance measurement pilot projects) as pilot projects in performance budgeting. Requires the Director, as an alternative budget presentation in the budget for FY 1999, to include the performance budgets of the designated agencies for this fiscal year. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to develop a strategic planning and performance measurement training component for its management training program and otherwise provide managers with an orientation on the development and use of strategic planning and program performance measurement.
