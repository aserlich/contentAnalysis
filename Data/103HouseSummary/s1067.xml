Authorizes the President to conclude an agreement with Mexico to establish a binational commission to be known as the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission. Declares that it should be the duty of the Commission to: (1) conduct a needs assessment in the U.S.-Mexican border area to identify and resolve health problems that affect the general population of the area; (2) coordinate public and private persons to educate the population about, and resolve, such health problems and develop programs to meet needs that are not being met by such persons; and (3) formulate recommendations for a fair method by which the government of one country would reimburse a public or private person in the other country for the cost of a health care service furnished to a citizen or resident alien of the first country who is unable to pay for the service.
