	3/30/1993--Introduced.
Makes a Member of Congress ineligible to participate in the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), with the exception of any individual who, as of the enactment of this Act, satisfies the mandatory requirements for being considered eligible for an annuity. States that nothing in this Act shall prevent appropriate refunds from being made on account of an individual becoming ineligible to participate in FERS. Requires a Member who becomes ineligible to participate in FERS to be treated in the same way as if separated from service. Makes provisions of this Act inapplicable with respect to: (1) any former Member of Congress who, as of the enactment of this Act, is entitled to a FERS annuity; or (2) any individual who, as of the enactment of this Act, is entitled to any annuity as a survivor of a former Member of Congress.
