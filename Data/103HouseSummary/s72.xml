	<summary>
	1/21/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit any officer, agent, or employee (currently, officer or employee) of the United States from effecting an arrest in any foreign country as part of a foreign police action (currently, a foreign police action with respect to narcotics control). Prohibits such individuals from authorizing, carrying out, or assisting in the abduction of any person within the territory of a foreign state without the express consent of such state. Exempts from such prohibitions the seizure of any official, agent, or employee of a state during armed hostilities for purposes of bringing such person to trial for violations of international laws of war. Bars the prosecution by the U.S. Government of a person abducted in violation of this Act if the state in which the abduction occurred objects and provides for the return of such person to the state in the event of an objection.
