	3/17/1994--Introduced.
Interstate Municipal Solid Waste Control Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize State Governors to limit the quantity of out-of-State municipal solid waste (MSW) received for disposal at landfills or incinerators to an annual quantity equal to that received during 1990, 1991, or 1992, whichever is less. Limits the quantity of out-of-State MSW received to an annual quantity no greater than 30 percent of all MSW received in 1990, 1991, or 1992, whichever is less, if, during such year, the landfill or incinerator received documented shipments of more than 50,000 tons of out-of-State MSW representing more than 30 percent of all MSW received during the calendar year concerned. Provides for further limits in 1995 through 1997. Authorizes State Governors to prohibit the disposal of out-of-State MSW in: (1) new landfills or incinerators; or (2) landfills or incinerators that do not meet certain requirements of Federal and State laws. Permits State Governors to treat any out-of-State industrial solid waste as out-of-State MSW if it is disposed of at a landfill or incinerator that receives MSW. Authorizes counties to exercise the same authorities with respect to out-of-State MSW as State Governors, except that the 30 percent limitation described in this Act shall be 20 percent. Prohibits discrimination against shipments of out-of-State solid waste on the basis of State of origin. Authorizes a State Governor to limit or prohibit the exportation outside the State of MSW generated in the State, except for materials that have been separated from MSW for recycling. Exempts from the requirements of this Act: (1) material that has been separated or diverted from MSW and has been transported into the State for purposes of recycling and any material returned from a dispenser or distributor to the manufacturer for credit, evaluation, or reuse (this section does not apply to material disposed of in a landfill or incinerator); (2) solid waste generated by an industrial facility and transported for purposes of treatment, storage, or disposal to a facility owned or operated by the waste generator; and (3) solid waste generated incident to the provision of air transportation.
