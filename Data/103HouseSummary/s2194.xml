Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act - Directs the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) to establish, implement, maintain, evaluate, and report to the Congress annually on a personnel management system that: (1) ensures that applicants for employment and employees of the AOC are appointed, promoted, and assigned on the basis of merit and fitness after fair and equitable consideration of all applicants and employees through open competition; (2) provides an equal employment opportunity program which includes an affirmative employment program and procedures for monitoring progress by the AOC in ensuring a workforce reflective of the diverse labor force; (3) includes a system for classification of positions which takes into account the difficulty, responsibility, and qualification requirements of the work performed and which conforms to the principle of equal pay for substantially equal work; (4) has a training program for AOC employees which has among its goals improved employee performance and opportunities for employee advancement; (5) has a formal performance appraisal system which will permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria for all AOC employees; (6) has a fair and equitable system to address unacceptable conduct and performance by AOC employees, including a general statement of violations, sanctions, and procedures which shall be made known to all employees and a formal grievance procedure; (7) has a program to provide services to deal with mental health, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and other employee problems and which ensures employee confidentiality; and (8) has a formal policy statement regarding the use and accrual of sick and annual leave which shall be made known to all employees and which is consistent with the requirements of this Act. Requires all personnel actions affecting AOC employees to be made free from any discrimination prohibited by: (1) the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (2) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; (3) the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and (4) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Sets forth procedures for consideration of alleged violation of such provisions by AOC employees (including those assigned to the Senate Restaurants or to the Superintendent of the Senate Office Building). Declares that any intimidation of, or reprisal against, any AOC employee or by any AOC employee, because of the exercise of a right under such provisions constitutes an unlawful employment practice which may be remedied in the same manner as are other violations described in this Act. Amends the General Accounting Office Personnel Act of 1980 to prohibit a current or former officer or employee of the AOC from being appointed as a member of the General Accounting Office Personnel Appeals Board. Authorizes the Board to consider and order corrective or disciplinary action in a case arising from an action involving discrimination prohibited under this Act. Subjects the final decision of the Board to judicial review. Allows an AOC employee to be awarded attorney's fees if she or he prevails in such case.
