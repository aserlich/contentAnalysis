	<summary>
	6/10/1994--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the Department of Justice should repudiate its interpretation of a provision of the Federal criminal code pertaining to the destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities as extending the reach of such provision to law enforcement operations and actions taken by U.S. agencies; and (2) the Department of Defense and other U.S. departments and agencies should resume their former authorized practice of providing aid, information, and material support to locate, interdict, and prevent the operation of illegal drug producers and traffickers in the Andean nations and wherever else such operations have been impeded by such interpretation.
