Limits Federal assistance to the Northern Mariana Islands for FY 1994 through 1998 as set forth in the Agreement of the Special Representatives on Future Federal Financial Assistance of the Northern Mariana Islands of December 1992. Continues the payment of a specified annual amount after FY 1998 unless otherwise provided by law. Bars the obligation of funds in accordance with the Agreement until the Secretary of the Interior certifies to specified congressional committees in each fiscal year that the Northern Mariana Islands: (1) does not have an amount of aliens that exceeds the 1992 average daily number of aliens in the Islands as determined by the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and imposes a specified numerical limitation on the number of alien workers admitted for employment in the garment industry; (2) is implementing a petitioning mechanism to measure and compare the number of alien admissions with the 1992 average and provides the INS with such information for verification purposes; (3) has enacted and is enforcing measures to raise revenues; (4) is implementing a rate schedule approved by the Secretary that will phase in charges for users of utilities to recover specified costs of power, water, and sewer services; (5) has plans approved by the Secretary for the use of project funds; and (6) has enacted and is enforcing laws to provide no greater deductions from wages for housing, food, transportation, health care, employment fees, or other expenses for workers not permanently admitted into the Islands than are contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and which allow for the same exemptions from the payment of minimum wages as provided in such Act.
