	<summary>
	5/23/1994--Reported to Senate amended. Veterans Benefits and Services Amendments of 1994 - Entitles veterans who have repaid in full a previous home loan guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs to another home loan, whether or not the property securing the first loan has been sold or otherwise disposed of. (Current law requires such sale, even if the loan has been repaid in full.) Allows veterans to refinance an existing guaranteed loan in order to make energy efficiency improvements. Changes from August 5, 1964, to February 28, 1961, the date for the beginning of the Vietnam era for purposes of Federal veterans' benefits provisions for veterans who served in the Republic of Vietnam. Excludes the payment to Alaska Natives of cash, stock, land, or other interests representing dividends paid under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act from the calculation of annual income in the determination of eligibility for veterans' pensions. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter into an agreement with the Caring Place at Loyola, Inc., an Illinois nonprofit organization, for establishing on the grounds of the Edward Hines, Jr., Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Hines, Illinois, a facility for the provision of temporary accommodations for family members of severely ill children being treated at the Loyola of Chicago Medical Center.
