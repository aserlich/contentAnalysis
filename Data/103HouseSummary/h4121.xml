District of Columbia Building Heights Act of 1994 - Amends the District of Columbia Code to revise provisions with respect to street widths controlling building heights in the District to require that if the alignment (currently, course) of streets forming an intersection is not interrupted by a public space or reservation confronting a building, the limit of height of the building shall be determined from the width of the widest street, avenue, or highway. Defines &quot;street&quot; to mean any road, avenue, drive, cart way, or other route open to the public as a regular right-of-way, but not an alley. Replaces provisions allowing the heights of spires, towers, domes, minarets, pinnacles, penthouses over elevator shafts, ventilation shafts, chimneys, smokestacks, and fire sprinkler tanks to exceed mandatory limitations with provisions allowing roof structures that are not constructed or used for human occupancy to be erected to a greater height than any mandatory limit for the District with the Mayor's approval, provided that: (1) the roof structure must not be higher than 18.5 feet above the roof upon which it is located; (2) it must be fireproof; (3) the area of such a structure must not exceed one third of the total roof area for those districts where there is a limitation on the number of stories or one-half of the total roof area for any other districts; (4) there may be an increase in the allowable floor area ratio for such a structure of not more than 25 percent; (5) such structure shall be set back from the exterior or bounding walls of the building upon which the structure is placed at distances equal to its height above the adjacent roof; (6) an exterior or bounding wall of a building is any wall having a dimension of four feet or more in height or horizontal depth exposed to the outside (without regard to whether the wall abuts another structure); and (7) a skylight shall not be considered a roof structure if it is less than five feet in height. Increases the fine for violation of: (1) the Act to not more than $10,000 per day (currently, not less than ten dollars nor more than $100 per day); and (2) a court injunction resulting from such violation to not more than $100,000 (currently, not less than $100 nor more than $500). Requires the approval of the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the Mayor before a roof structure of any building in the District can exceed building height limitations. Allows the NCPC or any of its members to request a determination of whether any building proposed to be constructed in the District meets mandatory requirements. Allows the NCPC to file charges in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia against an individual who violates building height requirements and to maintain an action in such Court to abate and perpetually enjoin such nuisance. Provides that the NCPC and each of its members shall have standing to enforce any limitation on the heights of buildings and structures in the District.
