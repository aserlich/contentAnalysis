	8/19/1994--Passed Senate amended. TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Study of Claims Adjudication Title II: Improvements to Claims Adjudication Title III: Miscellaneous Veterans' Claims Adjudication Improvement Act of 1994 - Title I: Study of Claims Adjudication - Directs the U.S. Administrative Conference to carry out a study of the Department of Veterans Affairs system for the disposition of claims for veterans' benefits, with a purpose of enhancing the efficiency of the process and expedient disposition of claims. Requires: (1) Conference consultation with non-Department entities such as veterans service organizations and other veteran representatives; and (2) cooperation by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in providing information required for such study. Requires reports. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Improvements to Claims Adjudication - Authorizes (current law requires) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to receive annual income verification information before granting or continuing veterans' pension benefits. Directs the Secretary to accept from a claimant a photocopy of a document as proof of the existence of a marriage, the birth of a child, or the death of a family member. Authorizes a physician employed by the Veterans Health Administration to accept from a private physician of a claimant a medical examination report if such report contains sufficient clinical data to support the diagnosis or degress of a disability. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on the status of an agreement with the Secretary of Defense for the immediate transfer from the Department of Defense of a member's medical records upon separation from active duty. Title III: Miscellaneous - Amends the Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act to state that regulations required under such Act may not prohibit a veteran from establishing service connection for a disease or disability that the veteran claims to be a result of exposure to ionizing radiation during a period of military service. Directs the Secretary to take appropriate actions to determine whether the injury of any veteran as a result of medical treatment was the result of medical malpractice by the Department of Veterans Affairs and, if so, to provide appropriate compensation.
