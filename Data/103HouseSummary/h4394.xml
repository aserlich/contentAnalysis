	<summary>
	10/3/1994--Passed House amended. Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act of 1994 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to provide for the establishment of a nationwide toll-free telephone number to be used by State one-call (call before you dig) notification systems. Requires each State to consider whether to adopt a comprehensive statewide one-call notification program containing all elements required under this Act. Outlines required elements of the program, including prior notification of any intended excavations and its application to all excavators and underground facility operators. Provides an exception. Provides penalties for violations of the requirements of the program, as well as enforcement procedures. Directs the Secretary to make grants to States (or to operators of State notification systems) which have elected to establish and maintain a notification system with all required elements. Allows grants for alternative programs if they are at least as protective of the public health and safety and environment as a State program under this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) coordinate the implementation of this Act with Federal pipeline safety requirements; (2) review and report to the Congress on the achievement of the purposes of this Act; and (3) develop and make available to States a model State one-call notification program, with suggested elements. Requires each State to provide an initial and annual status reports on progress made in implementing a State program. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on accidents caused by routine railroad maintenance. Allows States to implement more protective notification systems than that required under this Act. Directs the Secretary to consult with other agencies as to the availability and affordability of technologies which will help relocate pipelines from above-ground and remote locations. Directs the Secretary to carry out a study under the vision waiver study program which would include drivers who failed to qualify under the original study program due to application time limits and the failure to learn of the program in a timely manner. Expresses the sense of the Congress that, to the greatest extent practicable, all equipment and products purchased with funds made available under this Act should be American-made. Requires notification of such preference to the recipients of assistance under this Act.
