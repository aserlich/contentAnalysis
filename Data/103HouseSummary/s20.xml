	6/23/1993--Passed Senate amended. Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 - Requires executive agency heads to submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congress a strategic plan for performance goals of their agency's program activities. Requires such plan to cover at least a five-year period and to be updated at least every three years. Requires the inclusion of performance plans in the President's budget. Directs the Director to require each agency to prepare annual performance plans covering each program activity in the agency's budget. Requires executive agency heads to report annually to the President and the Congress on program performance for the previous fiscal year, setting forth performance indicators, actual program performance, and a comparison with plan goals for that fiscal year. Specifies the contents of such reports. Authorizes the Director to exempt any agency with annual outlays of $20 million or less from strategic and performance plan reporting requirements. Allows performance plans to include proposals to waive administrative procedural requirements and controls in return for specific individual or organization accountability to achieve a performance goal. Requires the Director to designate: (1) no fewer than ten agencies (representing a range of Government functions) as pilot projects in performance measurement; (2) no fewer than five agencies (selected from agencies in performance measurement pilot projects) as pilot projects in managerial accountability and flexibility; and (3) no fewer than five agencies (selected from agencies in performance measurement pilot projects) as pilot projects in performance budgeting. Sets forth provisions with respect to strategic and performance planning at the U.S. Postal Service. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to develop a strategic planning and performance measurement training component for its management training.
