	6/16/1994--Passed Senate amended. Saguaro National Park Establishment Act of 1994 - Establishes the Saguaro National Park in Arizona. Abolishes the Saguaro National Monument and incorporates all of its lands and interest into the Park. Deems any reference to the Monument to be a reference to the Park. Modifies the boundaries of the Park to include additional lands. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire lands and interests within the additional lands only with the owner's consent unless the lands are being developed in a manner which is detrimental to the Park's integrity. Withdraws Federal lands within the Park from public land, U.S. mining, and all related mineral, geothermal leasing, and mineral materials laws. Authorizes appropriations.
