Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of the Interior for the Coastal Heritage Trail Route in New Jersey in addition to any sums appropriated for the Trail for use during fiscal years ending on or before September 30, 1993. Requires such funds to be used solely for technical assistance and the design and fabrication of interpretive materials, devices, and signs. Prohibits the funds from being used for operation, maintenance, repair, or construction except for construction of interpretive exhibits. Limits the Federal share of the total cost of any project carried out with such funds to 50 percent on a matching basis.
