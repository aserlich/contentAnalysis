	<summary>
	11/20/1993--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States should: (1) as part of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, negotiate a tariff-rate quota to replace Canada's chicken supply management system, as well as the elimination of processed chicken from Canada's Import Control List; (2) insist under such quota that the amount of chicken determined to be within quota be based on the total amount of chicken imported into Canada in 1993 through both global and supplemental import quotas; (3) seek the elimination or, at the minimum, phase-out of new duties imposed by Canada on chicken imports in accordance with the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement; and (4) oppose any Canadian activity which results in lost sales for U.S. chicken exporters and restricts U.S. access to Canadian markets.
