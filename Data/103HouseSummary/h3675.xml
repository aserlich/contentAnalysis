	11/22/1993--Introduced.
Defense Alternative Use Committee Act - Directs the head of each defense agency to require each contractor, as a condition of each defense contract for the provision of defense materials or services, to agree to establish an alternative use committee (committee) at each defense facility used under the contract that employs at least 100 employees. Requires the head of each Government defense facility to establish a committee of at least eight members, with equal representation between management and employees, to undertake economic conversion planning and preparation for the employment of its employees and utilization of its equipment and facilities in the event of a reduction or closure of such facility or the curtailment, conclusion, or disapproval of any defense contract. Provides for: (1) the appointment of community representatives to the committees; (2) prohibitions against discrimination against representatives of unorganized labor on such committees; and (3) funds for committee activities. Requires each committee to evaluate the assets of its facility and develop and review at least biennially a plan for the conversion of such facility to nondefense-related productive activity, to arrange for employee retraining and reemployment, and to dissolve itself after final defense facility conversion.
