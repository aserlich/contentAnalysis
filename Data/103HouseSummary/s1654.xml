	<summary>
	5/19/1994--Senate agreed to House amendment with amendment. Amends the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reserve Water Rights Settlement Act of 1992 to state that: (1) all environmental costs associated with the Tongue River Dam Project (Project) mandated by Federal law and fish and wildlife measures are the sole responsibility of the United States; (2) such funds (limited to $625,000) shall be in addition to Project funds provided for by such Act; (3) the Secretary of the Interior shall reimburse Montana for certain Project environmental compliance costs incurred prior to enactment of this Act (costs incurred subsequent to enactment reimbursable only with prior approval); and (4) authorization of appropriations, with specified exceptions, shall not be effective until the Montana water court enters and approves a settlement decree. Amends the San Carlos Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 1992 to change &quot;reimbursable&quot; to &quot;nonreimbursable&quot; with respect to certain Central Arizona Water Conservation District water costs. Makes a technical correction to the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994. Amends the White Earth Reservation Land Settlement Act of 1985 to permit a one-time deletion of certain erroneous land parcel determinations printed in the Federal Register. Provides a limited time in which to challenge such determinations. Prohibits new regulations and gives no effect to existing regulations that classify, enhance, or diminish the privileges and immunities of a federally recognized Indian tribe relative to other such tribes.
