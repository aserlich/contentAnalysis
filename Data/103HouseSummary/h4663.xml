(Sec. 104) Specifies the kinds of export licenses the Secretary of Commerce may require. Prohibits any person from exporting an item that such person knows will materially contribute to a program for the development of a weapon of mass destruction or missile in a country that is not a member of, or a cooperating country with respect to, an export control regime controlling such items. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish a United States Commodity Control Index identifying all commodities and technology on which controls are imposed under this Act; (2) specify license requirements for such items; and (3) designate countries and end users to which exports of commodities and technology are controlled. Requires the Secretary to appoint export advisory committees with respect to export controls imposed on such items. (Sec. 105) Authorizes the President to prohibit or curtail the export of commodities or technology that would: (1) significantly enable a country or end user to acquire weapons of mass destruction; or (2) significantly contribute to the military capability of a country so as to pose a threat to the national security of the United States or its allies. Requires the Secretary to establish a security control list of commodities, technology, countries, and end users with respect to which export controls are imposed by this Act. Provides that the Secretary shall require authority to export commodities and technology on the security control list to a controlled country, a controlled end use, or a controlled end user. Sets forth provisions regarding the creation of multilateral export control regimes. Provides favorable licensing treatment for the export of commodities and technology among such regimes.

Requires the Secretary of State to propose the elimination of controls on mass-market computer equipment to export control regimes that control such equipment. Declares that, in specified circumstances, approval shall be presumed for a license for export to a country of any controlled goods, without regard to their technical specifications, for trade show purposes. Directs the Secretary to enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering to study and report to the President and the Congress on the extent to which exports of computers can be controlled, and the policy reasons for maintaining controls. (Sec. 106) Authorizes the President to prohibit or curtail unilaterally the export of commodities or technology whenever it is essential to U.S. national security or foreign policy, or to prevent foreign countries from supporting acts of international terrorism. Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of State to seek support from other countries and multilateral export control regimes for such controls. Prohibits export or reexport of controlled commodities or technology to countries that have repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism. Declares that crime control and detection instruments and equipment shall be approved for export by the Secretary only pursuant to an export license, with specified exceptions. (Sec. 107) Authorizes the President to prohibit or impose quantitative restrictions on the export of commodities that are domestically in short supply. Directs the Secretary to monitor exports, and contracts for exports, of commodities in cases where the volume of such commodities in relation to domestic supply contributes, or may contribute, to an increase in domestic prices or a domestic shortage, and such increase or shortage has, or may have, a serious adverse impact on the economy. Authorizes an entity, including a trade association, firm, or certified union or group of workers, that is representative of an industry that processes metallic materials capable of being recycled to petition the Secretary requesting both the monitoring of or the imposition of export controls on such exports that are in short supply. Prohibits the export of Alaskan North Slope crude oil, with specified exceptions. Provides for licensing of refined petroleum product exports.

(Sec. 108) Directs the President to issue regulations that prohibit, with specified exceptions, U.S. persons from supporting any boycott imposed by a foreign country against a country friendly to the United States that is not itself the object of a U.S. boycott. (Sec. 109) Specifies procedures for the processing of export license applications, including the screening, referral, approval or denial, and review of such applications. (Sec. 110) Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. (Sec. 111) Directs the Secretary to establish a list of dual use commodities and technology that would directly and substantially assist a foreign government or group in acquiring the capability to develop, produce, stockpile, or deliver chemical or biological weapons, the licensing of which would be effective in barring acquisition or enhancement of such capability. Requires a validated license for the export of listed items to any country of concern. Requires the Secretary to establish a list of all dual use commodities and technology on the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex (MTCR), including such items that would provide a direct and significant impact on the development of missile delivery systems. Requires a validated license for the export of such items on the MTCR list to any country, including any country not an MTCR adherent. Amends the Arms Export Control Act to require the Secretary of State to establish, as part of the United States Munitions List (Munitions List), a list of items not subject to specified control that would directly and substantially assist a foreign government, group, or project in acquiring the capability to develop, produce, stockpile, or deliver chemical or biological weapons, the licensing of which would be effective in barring the acquisition or enhancement of such capability. Requires a license for the export of such items on such list. Requires the Secretary of State to establish a list of items, including those items on the MTCR Annex, that would provide a direct and significant impact on the development of missile delivery systems, and the export of which is not subject to control under this Act. Requires a validated license for the export of such items on such list to any country, including any country not an MTCR adherent. Provides that such licenses shall be denied if the ultimate consignee of such items is a facility in a country that: (1) is not an MTCR adherent and it is designed to develop or build missiles; or (2) has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism. Requires the President to impose sanctions, for a two year period, against any U.S. or foreign person who, or entity that, knowingly exports or transfers chemical or biological weapons or missiles. Sets forth such sanctions to include: (1) denial of an export license; (2) barring of Government procurement contracts; and (3) appropriate import restrictions on the products of an offending entity.

Authorizes the Secretary to participate in the education and training of officials from other countries on the principles and procedures for implementation of effective export controls. Declares that a license may not be required for the export of a commodity solely because it contains parts or components subject to export control if they: (1) are essential to the functioning of the good; (2) are customarily included in the sales of the item in non-controlled countries; and (3) comprise 25 percent or less of the total value of the good, unless the good itself would make a significant contribution to the military or proliferation potential of a controlled country or end user which would prove detrimental to U.S. national security. Declares that no authority may be required for certain reexports of foreign-made items incorporating U.S. items. Declares that this Act does not authorize export controls on: (1) medicine or medical supplies; or (2) donations of items intended to meet basic human needs, including food, educational materials, seeds, hand tools, water resources equipment, clothing and shelter materials, and basic household supplies.

Makes it a duty of the U.S. executive directors of such institutions to consider whether a country receiving financial assistance: (1) is seeking to acquire unsafeguarded special nuclear material or a nuclear explosive device; (2) is not a State Party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; or (3) has detonated a nuclear explosive device. (Sec. 224) Prohibits any U.S. person or a foreign person from knowingly, materially, and directly contributing or attempting to contribute, through the provision of financing, to the acquisition of unsafeguarded special nuclear material, or the use, development, production, or stockpiling of any nuclear explosive device by an individual, group, or non-nuclear-weapon state. Requires the President to impose certain sanctions against any U.S. person or foreign person who violates such prohibition. (Sec. 225) Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to require the Secretary of State to report to appropriate congressional committees and to the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank if a country has willfully aided or abetted a non-nuclear-weapon state in acquiring any nuclear explosive device or unsafeguarded special nuclear material. (Sec. 226) Requires the President to report to the Congress, and impose certain sanctions against, any country that: (1) transfers to a non-nuclear- weapon state a nuclear explosive device; (2) is a non-nuclear-weapon state and either receives a nuclear explosive device, or detonates one; (3) transfers to a non-nuclear-weapon state any design information or component that is important to the development of a nuclear device; or (4) is a non-nuclear- weapon state and receives such information or component. (Sec. 227) Amends the Arms Export Control Act to prohibit the use of any funds under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or this Act to provide economic assistance, military assistance or grant military education and training, foreign assistance, or extend military credits or make guarantees, to any country which delivers to or receives from another country nuclear enrichment equipment, materials, or technology, unless certain conditions are met.
