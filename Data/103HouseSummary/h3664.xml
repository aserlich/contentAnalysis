Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge Title IV: State and Federal Cooperation Title V: Don Edwards Center for Environmental Education at San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge Title VI: Amendments to the Coastal Barrier Resources System Title VII: Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Title I: Fish Hatchery Conveyances - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey without reimbursement all U.S. interest in: (1) the New London National Fish Hatchery production facility to the State of Minnesota for the Minnesota fishery resources management program; (2) the Fairport National Fish Hatchery to the State of Iowa for use by the State for fishery resources management purposes; and (3) the Corning National Fish Hatchery to the State of Arkansas for use as part of the State's fish culture program. Title II: Ocean Radioactive Waste Dumping Ban - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to remove the definition for, and certain references to, &quot;high-level radioactive waste&quot; (thus expanding the current ban on dumping high-level radioactive waste to cover dumping of all radioactive waste). Removes provisions which prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from issuing a permit for the disposal of radioactive waste in the ocean until the permit applicant prepares a Radioactive Material Disposal Impact Assessment. Provides that nothing in this Act shall affect the transportation of material containing de minimis levels of radioactivity for purposes of dumping it into ocean waters under such Act. Title III: The Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge - Directs the Secretary to construct and operate a visitor center at the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge in Atlantic County, New Jersey, for purposes of: (1) providing public opportunities, facilities, and resources to study the natural history and natural resources of New Jersey and its coast and to highlight and research areas and artifacts of historical significance within the Refuge; (2) fostering an awareness and understanding of the interactions among wildlife, coastal and wetland ecosystems, and human activities both in a modern and historical context; and (3) providing office space and facilities for Refuge administration, research, educational, and related activities. Sets forth provisions regarding design, size, and location of such a facility and cost-sharing. Title IV: State and Federal Cooperation - Directs the Secretary and the heads of other Federal agencies to consult and cooperate with State fish and wildlife agency personnel on areas of mutual concern involving the conservation of fish, wildlife and their habitats, and the implementation of Federal laws involving the conservation of such species and their habitats. Exempts the Secretary and such heads, in cooperating with such agencies, from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Title V: Don Edwards Center for Environmental Education at San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge - Directs the Secretary to rename the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge visitor center as the Don Edwards Center for Environmental Education. (Sec. 503) Authorizes the Secretary to solicit, accept, and expend contributions of funds from non-Federal sources to help support the costs of operation and maintenance of the Center. Title VI: Amendments to the Coastal Barrier Resources System - Directs the Secretary to make technical corrections to the Coastal Barrier Resources System maps necessary to ensure that: (1) depictions of areas on those maps are consistent with the depictions of areas appearing on other specified maps; and (2) the Coastal Barrier Resources System does not include any areas that were part of unit FL-05P. Authorizes appropriations. Title VII: Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation - Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994 - Requires the Secretary to provide financial assistance for conservation of rhinoceros and tiger projects. Authorizes the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Secretariat, or any other person, to submit to the Secretary a project proposal for the conservation of such animals. Sets forth provisions regarding criteria for approval and project reporting. Directs the Secretary to give consideration to projects which will enhance sustainable development programs to ensure effective, long-term conservation of rhinoceros and tigers.
