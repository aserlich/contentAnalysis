	<summary>
	6/24/1994--Introduced.
Provides that: (1) it should be the policy of the United States at international bodies to advocate the creation of an international conservatorship for Haiti; (2) such conservatorship should be responsible for coordinating and administering the delivery of bilateral assistance from international financial institutions, should be of a fixed duration, should seek to rebuild political, economic, and social institutions, and should be established only if the Haitian elected officials and senior military officers voluntarily surrender the responsibility for administering public services (including security and military affairs); (3) the properly elected civilian leadership of Haiti should agree to work closely on domestic policy matters with the conservatorship; and (4) the conservatorship should be created under the authority of the UN Security Council and should operate subject to a resolution adopted by the Security Council and a budget approved by the General Assembly.
