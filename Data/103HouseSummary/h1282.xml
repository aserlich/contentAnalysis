	3/10/1993--Introduced.
Outer Continental Shelf Enhanced Exloration and Deep Water Incentives Act - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to suspend any royalty or net profit share set forth in Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil or gas leases. Declares that no royalty payment shall be due on new production from leases located in depths of 200 meters or more until the capital costs directly related to such production have been recovered out of the resulting proceeds. Requires the Secretary to designate as frontier areas those portions of the OCS with respect to which the Secretary will exercise authority to modify royalty payment requirements.
