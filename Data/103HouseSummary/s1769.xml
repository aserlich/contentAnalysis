	11/23/1993--Passed House amended. Authorizes the city of Slidell, Louisiana, to submit a final statement of objectives, within ten days of enactment of this Act, with respect to a FY 1994 community development block grant (CDBG). Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to consider and accept such final statement. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to permit Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to use up to 20 percent of FY 1994 CDBG assistance for public service. Authorizes the Secretary to convert the Leonard Terrace Apartments in Grand Rapids, Michigan, from a leased housing contract to a project-based rental assistance contract upon the repayment of certain funds received by the concerned public housing agency. Considers newly constructed multifamily property in New York City, New York, to have met certain Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 automatic sprinkler requirements if equivalent safety levels have been met.
