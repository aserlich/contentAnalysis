Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) assist the Commission in such review upon request; and (2) transmit an analysis of the Director's recommendations to the Commission and the congressional budget committees after the Commission has submitted its recommendations to the President and those committees. Sets forth procedures for: (1) formulation of the Director's recommendations; (2) consideration of Commission recommendations by the President and the Congress; and (3) implementation of final Commission recommendations. Establishes in the Treasury the Reinventing Government Account 1994 for use in closing and consolidating Federal offices and disposing of surplus Government property. Requires the Director to: (1) transmit reports on closure and consolidation operations to the congressional budget committees as part of the annual budget process; and (2) make annual downward adjustments in the discretionary spending limits of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 by the aggregate amount of reductions in discretionary spending for the fiscal year involved. Provides that: (1) none of the changes in direct spending resulting from this Act shall be reflected in OMB estimates under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act); and (2) all receipts resulting from this Act shall be used solely to reduce the public debt.
