Senate Procedures Reform Resolution of 1994 - Amends rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate to revise the numbers of Senators comprising Senate standing, select, and special committees. Revises service limitations to prohibit any Senator from serving on: (1) more than one of the Aging, Budget, Joint Economic, Rules and Administration, Small Business, and Veterans' Affairs Committees; (2) more than one (currently, two) subcommittee of any such Committee of which he or she is a member; (3) both the Appropriations and Finance Committees; (4) both the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees; or (5) more than two (currently, three) subcommittees of each of the Committees on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, Armed Services, Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Commerce, Science and Transportation, Energy and Natural Resources, Environment and Public Works, Finance, Foreign Relations, Governmental Affairs, the Judiciary, and Labor and Human Resources of which he or she is a member. Permits waiver of service limitations only by a resolution designating the Senators affected. Amends rule XXVI to allow only certain committees to meet on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and only certain other committees to meet on Thursdays, unless consent is obtained from the majority and minority leaders. Permits subcommittees to meet only on the day the full committee may meet at a time when the full committee is not meeting. Requires the chairman of each committee of the Senate to maintain a record of committee attendance and voting records to be made available to the public. Requires the Secretary of the Senate, by January 31 each year, to certify and publish in the Congressional Record a list identifying each member of the Senate who has used less than the amount allocated to the personal office of the member during the preceding fiscal year and the amount of such unused allocation.
