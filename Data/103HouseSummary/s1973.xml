	<summary>
	3/24/1994--Introduced.
Directs the Attorney General to establish a program under which the Attorney General will enter into agreements to contribute up to 50 percent of the funds needed to pay startup costs of handgun exchange programs operated by local governments or private entities in which merchandise or services, tickets or certificates that may be used to acquire merchandise or services, or other non-cash incentives are given in exchange for handguns, subject to specified requirements. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) such Federal program's termination date; (2) the allocation of funds (with priority to programs in areas experiencing high rates of crime in which handguns are used, but with urban and rural areas each receiving an appropriate amount of assistance); and (3) reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations.
