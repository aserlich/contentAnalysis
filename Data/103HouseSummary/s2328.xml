	7/27/1994--Introduced.
Federal Acquisition Labor Law Improvement Act of 1994 - Amends the Davis-Bacon Act (DBA) to provide for wage determinations based on the locality where the work is performed. Requires contractors and subcontractors covered by DBA to pay laborers and mechanics unconditionally at least weekly without subsequent deduction or rebate, except for certain union dues when the worker gives written authorization. Applies DBA requirements to laborers and mechanics employed by the contractor or subcontractor to: (1) work directly upon the site of the work, including work at fabrication plants, batch plants, tool yards, or similar facilities not on the project site but dedicated exclusively, or nearly so, to project construction (except previously established facilities whose location and continuance in operation are determined wholly without regard to the contract work); and (2) transport materials, supplies, and equipment to or from the worksite. (This includes truckdrivers, except those employed by an independent trucking company or material supplier for hauling from a permanent previously established facility to the worksite.) Increases the minimum threshold (currently $2,000) for DBA coverage of contracts for public buildings and works to: (1) $100,000 for new construction, complete rehabilitation, or reconstruction; and (2) $50,000 for repairs or alterations. Sets conditions for coverage of leased property. Provides for periodic adjustments of such thresholds. Prohibits splitting contracts. Sets preemption conditions. Revises DBA enforcement provisions, including: (1) administrative procedures, including the Secretary of Labor's authority with respect to payment of workers, debarment of contractors, and coordination of enforcement; (2) review procedures, including court review of coverage determinations; and (3) creation of a private right of action for workers. Amends the Copeland Act to: (1) eliminate weekly payroll data submission for contracts of $100,000 or less; and (2) change such weekly requirement to a monthly one for contracts of more than $100,000, with provisions for waivers for contractors or subcontractors who have demonstrated compliance with DBA and other labor standards. Revises enforcement provisions to: (1) require contractors and subcontractors to maintain payroll and related records for three years after completion of contract work and make such records available upon request of the contracting officer or the Secretary; (2) grant the Secretary subpoena and debarment authority with respect to records; and (3) establish penalties for false records. Amends the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act to provide that: (1) the Secretary, rather than the Comptroller General, shall initiate debarment action for violations; and (2) the General Services Administration (GSA) shall include the names of those debarred on a governmentwide list. Amends the Service Contract Act to eliminate a five-year limitation on a contract period. Directs the Secretary to debar contractors for violations and transmit their names to the GSA for inclusion on the governmentwide list.
