	<summary>
	2/18/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to subject goods imported from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to column one rates of the tariff schedule (and deny them labeling as having been manufactured in the United States) unless the Commonwealth establishes that: (1) the labor rate paid to the workers producing such goods is greater than or equal to the prevailing U.S. minimum wage rate; and (2) not less than 50 percent of the direct labor cost of producing such goods is paid to Commonwealth residents. Requires the Secretary of Labor to assign a resident compliance officer to the Commonwealth to monitor its compliance with such conditions.
