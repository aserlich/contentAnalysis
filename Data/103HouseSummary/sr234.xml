	<summary>
	6/28/1994--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that the U.S. Government should: (1) enunciate a policy to promote democracy in Burma; (2) encourage members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the July meetings in Bangkok to join U.S. efforts to seek the immediate release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, achieve the transfer of power to the winners of the 1990 democratic election, join the U.S. arms embargo against Burma, and end human rights abuses perpetrated by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC); (3) indicate continued U.S. opposition to SLORC participation in ASEAN; (4) work to implement United Nations (UN) General Assembly resolution 48/150 and pledge to seek international sanctions through the UN and the appointment of a special envoy; (5) oppose commercial arrangements and foreign aid and financial assistance from international finance institutions that only provide financial support for the SLORC; (6) encourage the Government of Thailand to allow Burmese political leaders and refugees to continue their efforts to bring democratic change to Burma without fear of harassment or other pressure; (7) continue the current policy of not sending an ambassador to Rangoon until the SLORC has taken steps to end human rights abuses and transfer power to the democratically elected leaders of Burma; and (8) investigate claims of forced repatriation of Rohingya refugees.
