Specifies that such construction should aim to provide sufficient capacity to incarcerate such offenders who exhibit a high risk for continued or violent criminal activity for such terms, including individuals: (1) with three or more arrests by age 18; (2) with a history of violent criminal offenses; and (3) exhibiting a pattern of crimes of premeditation and deliberation for whom a prison stay may have a significant deterrent value. Authorizes the Director to make such grants to States to operate prison facilities including costs for administration and staff. (Sec. 102) Sets forth application requirements. Directs that each State application include a comprehensive plan containing: (1) a description of the correctional facility needs in the State, including relevant supporting data; (2) a description of the resources available to build additional correctional facility capacity, together with an account of the expenses involved that cannot be met with existing resources at the State and local levels; (3) an explanation of how the State will be able to sustain the increased operation and maintenance costs of expanded correctional facility capacity; and (4) an evaluation component, including quantifiable data, that measures progress toward meeting the prison capacity goals under this subtitle. (Sec. 103) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) fund allocation; (2) grant renewal and limitations; and (3) grant approval and disapproval procedures. Subtitle B: Major Offenders Programs and Felony Parole Violators - Authorizes the Director to make grants to States, for use by the States and units of local government, for purposes of developing and increasing the capacity and the effectiveness of major offenders programs that prioritize the arrest and prosecution of habitual and violent criminal offenders. Specifies that such programs shall include: (1) establishment or expansion of specialized major offender units in law enforcement and criminal prosecutor offices to identify, monitor, arrest, and prosecute major offenders; and (2) establishment or expansion of a State crime information center computer database to include the complete arrest histories of major offenders and parole violator units and other relevant information for use by law enforcement officers and criminal prosecutors. (Sec. 113) Sets forth application requirements. Directs that each State application include a comprehensive plan containing: (1) a description, with supporting data, of the crime problems attributable to major offenders and parole violators that improved law enforcement and prosecution programs may be able to decrease; (2) a description of the resources available to implement or expand major offenders and parole violators programs; and (3) an evaluation component. (Sec. 114) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) local applications; (2) fund allocation; (3) grant renewal and limitations; and (4) grant approval and disapproval procedures.

(Sec. 212) Requires: (1) State and Federal courts to send information, as determined necessary by the Director of the Office of Justice Assistance, regarding the conviction of third-time felons to such Office in a timely manner; (2) such Office to maintain a computer listing of individuals convicted of a third Federal or State felony offense and update such list in a timely manner; (3) such Office to transfer the names of such individuals to the General Services Administration for inclusion in the publication &quot;Lists of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs&quot;; and (4) representatives of a Government agency that is responsible for the distribution of a Federal benefit to consult such publication before granting such benefit. (Sec. 214) Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle B: Prison Work Programs - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require a State, in order to avoid a reduction of available funds by 25 percent (for redistribution to other participating States), to implement or continue a prison workfare program that requires an inmate who is physically able (as determined by the State Director of Corrections) to work a portion of each day. Title III: Repeal of Supervised Release Program - Repeals provisions authorizing the court to include a term of supervised release after imprisonment. Title IV: Drug Paraphernalia Tax - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax, equal to 100 percent of the price for which sold, on taxable smoking paraphernalia manufactured in or imported into the United States. Increases the tax on cigarette papers. Title V: Financing - Subtitle A: National Security - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should negotiate with member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and any other foreign nation with which the United States has a bilateral or multilateral defense agreement, with certain exceptions, to seek an agreement that provides for such nation to pay at least 50 percent of the overseas basing costs incurred by the United States for stationing its members and civilian personnel in that nation. Limits the U.S. share of overseas basing coats for FY 1995 and thereafter, lowering such percentage from 84 percent of such costs for FY 1995 to 50 percent of such costs for FY 1998 and thereafter. (Sec. 502) Directs the Secretary of the Army to reorganize and reduce offices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in order to achieve at least $50 million in net annual savings by FY 1998.

(Sec. 507) Rescinds or reduces: (1) FY 1994 defense operation and maintenance funds; (2) funding for the Food for Peace program under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (with a modification of loan terms); (3) funds for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; (4) funding for the International Development Association under the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1994; (5) funds for foreign military financing under the same Act; and (6) funds for the Agency for International Development, Department of State, and the United States Information Agency. Subtitle B: Physical Capital, Natural Resources, and Science - Terminates the spacelifter program.
