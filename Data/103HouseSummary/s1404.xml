	8/6/1993--Introduced.
Sunshine in Litigation Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal judicial code to require a court to enter an order (under rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) restricting the disclosure of information obtained through discovery or restricting access to court records in a civil case only after making particularized findings of fact that such order would not restrict the disclosure of information which is relevant to the protection of public health or safety. Provides that: (1) no such order shall continue in effect after the entry of final judgment unless at or after such entry the court makes a separate particularized finding of fact that such order would not prevent the disclosure of information which is relevant to the protection of public health or safety; (2) the party who is the proponent for entry of the order shall have the burden of proof; (3) no agreement between or among parties in a civil action filed in a court of the United States may contain a provision that prohibits or otherwise restricts a party from disclosing any information relevant to such civil action to any Federal or State agency with authority to enforce laws regulating an activity related to such information; and (4) any such information disclosed to a Federal or State agency shall be confidential to the extent provided by law.
