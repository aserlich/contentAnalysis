Subtitle A: Designation and Tax Incentives - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for the designation of tax enterprise zones during calendar years after 1992 and before 1997: (1) by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in the case of an urban tax enterprise zone; and (2) by the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, in the case of a rural development investment zone. Sets forth the eligibility criteria for such designation for urban tax enterprise zones and for rural development investment zones. Allows an enterprise zone employment credit to small employers and tax-exempt organizations as a general business credit of 15 percent of the qualified zone wages. Allows such credit for the first five years of the employee's employment. Allows a deduction for the purchase of enterprise zone stock of 50 percent of the amount paid in cash.

Title II: Additional Assistance to Enterprise Zones And Other Distressed Communities - Subtitle A: National Public-Private Partnership Programs - Expresses the sense of the Congress that public-private partnerships between government and community-based organizations offer an opportunity to empower residents of low-income distressed communities and to forge innovative solutions to the challenges confronting these communities, and that increased resources should be invested in such partnerships. Authorizes appropriations to promote certain national public-private partnerships for FY 1993 through 2002. Specifies amounts to be available only for projects or activities that directly and principally benefit the residents of tax enterprise zones. Subtitle B: Coordinated and Comprehensive Neighborhood Aid for Tax Enterprise Zones and Other Communities - Chapter 1: Enterprise Community Block Grant Demonstration Program - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 2002 for the Interagency Council for Neighborhood Aid to carry out the Enterprise Community Block Grant Demonstration Program.

Provides for the allocation and use of such amounts for carrying out selected programs within such zones.

Subtitle C: Community Development Block Grant Program - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to raise the cap on assistance under the community development block grant program for units of general local government located within or containing an urban tax enterprise zone. Authorizes the Secretary of HUD to make loan guarantees for such units of local government for development activities. Subtitle D: Young Adult Employment Demonstration Program - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act to establish the young adult employment demonstration program to assist young adults with education, job training, and employment services in tax enterprise zones. Subtitle E: National Community Economic Partnership - National Community Economic Partnership Act of 1993 - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide assistance to States to carry out State plans for assistance to community development corporations. Describes the assistance available through nonrefundable lines of credit or grants. Subtitle F: Miscellaneous Programs - Enterprise Capital Access Fund Demonstration Program - Establishes a demonstration program to provide loans and technical assistance grants to nonprofit financial intermediaries in order to finance business and employment opportunities, low-income housing opportunities, and neighborhood revitalization projects.
