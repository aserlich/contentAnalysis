	3/23/1993--Introduced.
Supports the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) right to conduct inspections of any site in a nonnuclear weapon state party to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Condemns North Korea's decision to withdraw from the Treaty. Urges: (1) the United Nations Security Council to insist that North Korea provide the IAEA with full access before its official withdrawal from the Treaty and to impose sanctions on North Korea should it continue to refuse to provide such access; and (2) the President of the United States and the international community to take steps to strengthen the international nuclear nonproliferation regime.
