	<summary>
	8/6/1993--Introduced.
Commends the President for his decision to continue the moratorium on nuclear testing. Encourages the President to begin preparations expeditiously for multilateral negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is an essential component of international security and should be extended indefinitely in 1995; and (2) amounts that would have been made available to conduct nuclear tests during FY 1994 should be reallocated as specified, to pay the U.S. assessed contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency and for the preparatory commission of the Chemical Weapons Convention, to assist emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and the independent states of the former Soviet Union in developing an adequate system of export controls, and for the Reduced Enrichment in Research and Test Reactors Program.
