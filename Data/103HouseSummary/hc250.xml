	<summary>
	8/8/1994--Passed House amended. Supports the efforts undertaken by the Government of Mexico, the major political parties, and civic groups to reform that country's political and electoral processes and to ensure free and fair elections. Welcomes: (1) steps taken in recent months by such Government and political parties to increase the impartiality of the Federal electoral authorities, review the accuracy of the voter registry list, ensure fair media access, and reform campaign finance practices in accordance with the commitments enumerated in the January 1994 Agreement for Peace, Democracy, and Justice; and (2) the opportunity made available by the Mexican Congress for international visitors to witness such elections. Applauds the invitation extended by the Mexican Government to representatives of the United Nations (UN) to provide technical assistance and financing to domestic Mexican election observers. Encourages UN representatives to work closely and directly with Mexican observers during the electoral process. Notes the efforts of the Mexican observer groups to encourage citizen participation throughout the electoral process and to contribute to the success of this process by serving as monitors during the August 21, 1994, presidential and congressional elections. Expresses the hope that the efforts of the Mexican Government, the major political parties, and concerned members of civic society to reform the electoral process will be successful, and lead to elections that are accepted by all parties as fair and valid.
