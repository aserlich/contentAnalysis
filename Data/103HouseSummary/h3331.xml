Civil Rights Protection Act of 1993 - Makes any unit of State or local government liable to the injured party and to the United States for conduct of the unit's employee that subjects, under color of law, any person to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, regardless of whether the employee is personally liable and whether the employee had a reasonable belief in the lawfulness of the conduct. Exempts conduct which is entitled to absolute immunity. Authorizes: (1) with consent of the injured party, civil suit by the United States against the governmental unit to establish liability under this Act; (2) compensatory damages to the injured party; and (3) punitive damages to the injured party, the United States, or both. Establishes a time limit for initiation of actions under this Act.
