	3/10/1993--Introduced.
Requires the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, on application by the head of a State prison system, to promptly arrange and accept custody of prisoners who are sentenced to life imprisonment under a State habitual criminal statute, to the extent that space is available in the Federal prison system. Specifies that a decision of the Director shall not be subject to review in any court. Directs the Bureau to incarcerate any such prisoner: (1) until an appropriate State authority certifies to the Director that the prisoner's sentence has been terminated by parole, pardon, or otherwise as provided by State law; or (2) absent such certification, for the life of the prisoner.
