	4/22/1993--Introduced.
Congressional Pay for Performance Act - Suspends basic pay adjustments for Members of Congress, and requires pay reductions, until the deficit is reduced to below $50,000,000,000 without the enactment of any change in the Internal Revenue Code. Requires an annual reduction in pay by a percentage equal to: (1) two percent times the number of hundreds of billions of dollars of the deficit in the first year after enactment; or (2) twice that percentage for any year following a year for which the deficit is not at least $100,000,000,000 less than the lowest level attained after enactment of this Act. Suspends pay reductions upon enactment of a declaration of war and reinstates them when the state of war is concluded. Restores pay adjustment procedures suspended by this Act, and provides for a rate of basic pay of twice the rate in effect as of the effective date of this Act, for the first year with respect to which the deficit is less than $50,000,000,000.
