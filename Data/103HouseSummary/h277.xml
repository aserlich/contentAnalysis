Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act - Makes it unlawful for any licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to an unlicensed individual unless: (1) the transferor has received a statement of eligibility from the individual, has notified the chief law enforcement officer for such individual's place of residence about the proposed transfer, and either has received a response that such transfer is not prohibited or has not received a response indicating otherwise within seven days; (2) the individual has presented a statement from the officer that the individual requires a handgun because of a threat to him or his family; (3) the individual has presented a handgun permit issued in the past five years by the State in which the transfer is to take place which requires law enforcement verification of the individual's legal qualification to possess a handgun; (4) State law either requires a waiting period of at least seven days or requires that an authorized government official verify that possession of a handgun by the purchaser would not be unlawful; or (5) the transferor has received a report from any system of felon identification established by the Attorney General under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 that the individual's possession or receipt of the handgun would not violate Federal, State, or local law. Requires any transferor who, after a transfer, receives a report that receipt or possession of the handgun by the individual violates the law, to: (1) furnish information to the chief law enforcement officer of the transferor's place of business and the individual's place of residence; and (2) keep confidential any information received which is not otherwise available to the public, with exceptions. Sets forth transferor record-keeping requirements.
