(Sec. 1001) Exempts federally qualified health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and HMOs or managed care organizations recognized by State laws from the requirement to provide high-deductible coverage. Prohibits the offer of high-deductible coverage unless the carrier also makes standard coverage available with identical benefits and the individual or employee demonstrates that they have available assets equal to at least the deductible amount under the high-deductible coverage. Requires carriers to provide for coverage of benefits for items and services furnished throughout the fair rating area. Prohibits carriers from limiting coverage to portions of interstate metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), requiring them to provide coverage throughout the entire MSA. Requires coverage offers to include a family coverage option. Prohibits carriers from requiring employers under group health plans to impose waiting periods for health coverage or require conditions on health coverage based on an individual's: (1) health status; (2) claims experience; (3) receipt of health care; (4) medical history; (5) receipt of public subsidies; or (6) lack of evidence of insurability. (Sec. 1002) Requires carriers to accept every small employer and qualifying individual that applies for enrollment during the required enrollment period. Provides that in the case of coverage offered by carriers or under group health plans that provide benefits through a managed care arrangement, the carriers or plans: (1) need not establish health care facilities throughout the fair rating area if the facilities are located in a manner that does not discriminate on the basis of health status of individuals residing in proximity to such facilities; and (2) may deny coverage under certain conditions. Permits carriers to deny coverage if they do not have the necessary financial reserves. (Sec. 1003) Prohibits carriers from denying, cancelling, or refusing to renew health coverage except on the basis of nonpayment of premiums or fraud or because they are not providing a particular coverage option in the market. Sets limitations on market exit and re-entry by carriers. Establishes similar conditions for cancellation or denial by multiemployer plans and multiple employer health plans. (Sec. 1004) Prohibits carriers or group health plans from excluding coverage with respect to services provided for preexisting conditions, except as provided by this Act. Provides for exclusion periods of up to six months subject to certain conditions. Makes exclusions inapplicable to pregnancy, newborns, adopted children, and certain individuals enrolled or enrolling during an open enrollment period. (Sec. 1005) Sets forth provisions regarding enrollment periods. Part 2: Provision of Benefits - Establishes: (1) standards for managed care arrangements and requirements and utilization review programs; and (2) requirements for arrangements with essential community providers. (Sec. 1014) Provides for the establishment of medical savings accounts. Makes the account beneficiary the owner of the account and includes distributions not used for qualified medical expenses in the beneficiary's gross income. Sets forth uses and limitations for such accounts. Excludes: (1) employer contributions to any medical savings account of an eligible employee from gross income (to the extent such contributions do not exceed the excess of premiums for standard coverage over the premiums for high-deductible coverage); and (2) health benefit payments made by employers from employment taxes. Part 3: Fair Rating Practices - Provides that the premium rate established by carriers for health insurance coverage in the individual-small group market may not vary except by the following: (1) age; (2) geographic area; (3) family class; (4) benefit design of coverage and by type of coverage option; and (5) permitted expense category. (Sec. 1022) Directs carriers and group health plans to accept and apply premium certificates issued under State premium assistance programs under title XXI of the Social Security Act (as established by this Act). (Sec. 1023) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to request the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to develop a model risk adjustment system under which premiums applicable to coverage in the individual-small group market and coverage under small employer pooling arrangements and multiple employer welfare arrangements that are fully insured would be adjusted to take into account factors to predict the future need and efficient use of services by covered individuals in the market. Incorporates such model into a rule that specifies risk adjustment mechanisms. Requires each State to develop systems that conform with the Federal model. Part 4: Consumer Protections - Requires carriers and group health plans to provide information relating to their performance in providing coverage to specified individuals, including prospective enrollees. (Sec. 1032) Prohibits carriers from varying the commission or other remuneration to a person based on the claims experience or health status of individuals enrolled by or through such person. Subtitle B: Benefits - Sets forth provisions regarding standard coverage, preventive benefits to be covered without any deductible or cost-sharing, and high-deductible coverage. (Sec. 1105) Sets forth conditions under which supplemental benefits may be provided. (Sec. 1106) Requires carriers and group health plans to provide for an option under which children under 26 (without regard to whether they are students or disabled) will be treated as family members. Authorizes additional premiums for such option. (Sec. 1107) Includes coverage provided by Christian Science practitioners or in a Christian Science sanitorium within benefits under standard coverage. Subtitle C: Employer Responsibilities - Requires employers to make available to qualifying employees coverage under a group health plan that meets specified requirements, including: (1) an annual offering of coverage; (2) a choice of coverage and family coverage options; (3) an annual enrollment period; and (4) payroll withholding of premiums. (Sec. 1201) Provides that an employer is not required, subject to provisions regarding an equal contribution rule, to make any contribution to the cost of health coverage. Makes requirements regarding choice of coverage inapplicable if a group health plan is in effect as of July 1, 1994, and the employer makes contributions on behalf of employees under a collective bargaining agreement or similar contract. Excludes from this subtitle's requirements certain new and small employers. (Sec. 1202) Imposes an excise tax for failures of employers to comply with this subtitle. Subtitle D: Standards and Certification; Enforcement; Preemption; General Provisions - Directs the Secretary to request the NAIC to develop model regulations that specify standards with respect to this subtitle for carriers and health insurance coverage. (Sec. 1304) Imposes a tax on carriers that fail to comply with Parts 1 through 4 of Subtitle A and Subtitle B of this title unless a State has in effect a regulatory mechanism that provides sanctions. (Sec. 1305) Prohibits a single employer plan from offering health coverage other than through a carrier unless the plan has at least 100 eligible employees. Subtitle E: Multiple Employer Health Benefits Protections and Related Provisions - Part 1: Multiple Employer Health Benefits Protections - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to establish certification standards under title I (Protection of Employee Benefit Rights) for multiple employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs) providing health benefits. (Sec. 1401) Treats as employee welfare benefits plans, and exempts from certain restrictions on preemption, a MEWA which provides benefits consisting solely of specified medical care, which is not fully insured, and which applies for and receives a specified certification. Requires certain disclosures to participating employers. Requires certified MEWAs which are not fully insured to maintain excess-stop loss coverage and specified types of reserves. Sets forth corrective actions which such MEWAs' operating committees must take: (1) to avoid depletion of reserves; or (2) in connection with termination of the MEWA. Provides for review of actions by the Secretary of Labor with respect to denials of applications for, or suspensions or revocations of, such certifications. Requires, in cases where coverage is provided under a multiple employer health plan and more than ten percent of the participating employers are small employers, that the arrangement is maintained in the form of a small employer pooling arrangement. Sets forth requirements for such arrangements. (Sec. 1402) Revises ERISA with respect to: (1) a specified exemption from preemption; (2) treatment of single employer arrangements; and (3) treatment of certain collectively bargained arrangements. (Sec. 1405) Sets forth ERISA requirements relating to employee leasing health care arrangements (ELHAs). Provides for treatment of ELHAs as MEWAs, with certain exceptions. Sets forth special rules under which an ELHA may receive a MEWA certification. (Sec. 1408) Allows delegation to a State of some or all of the Secretary's enforcement authority with respect to MEWAs with certifications. Directs the Secretary to provide enforcement and technical assistance to the States with respect to MEWAs. Part 2: Simplifying Filing of Reports for Employers Covered under Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements Providing Fully Insured Coverage Consisting of Medical Care - Directs the Secretary to prescribe an alternative method for the filing of a single annual report for all participating employers under MEWAs under which all coverage consists of medical care and is fully insured. Subtitle F: Definitions; General Provisions - Part 1: Definitions - Sets forth specified definitions. (Sec. 1905) Makes this title effective for plan years beginning on or after 1997 with respect to group health plans and as of January 1, 1997, with respect to carriers (for coverage other than under a group health plan). Part 2: Report and Recommendations on Health Coverage and Access - Provides that it is an objective of this Act to assure by 2002 that: (1) all eligible individuals in the United States have access to health coverage; and (2) at least 95 percent of such individuals have such coverage. (Sec. 1912) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress on the extent to which eligible individuals have, or have access to, health care coverage. Title II: Removal Of Financial Barriers To Access - Subtitle A: Tax Deductibility for Individuals and Self-Employed - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) increase on a graduated basis the tax deduction for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals; (2) make the deduction permanent; (3) allow a tax deduction, regardless of whether the taxpayer itemizes other deductions, for health insurance costs of non-self-employed individuals not eligible to participate in any subsidized employer health plan; and (4) subject to taxation certain health benefits provided through cafeteria plans and flexible spending arrangements. Subtitle B: Premium and Cost-Sharing Subsidy Program for Low-Income Individuals - States that the amendments made by this subtitle and title III below provide for a transition from the current Medicaid system to a new system of acute care low-income assistance. (Sec. 2101) Amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to add a new title XXI providing for the establishment of new State programs under which, as a requirement for State participation in Medicaid, certain low-income eligible individuals who are not Medicare beneficiaries, SSI recipients, prison inmates, or unlawful aliens will be eligible for premium and cost-sharing assistance for use in obtaining qualifying coverage of the standard and preventive health benefits discussed above under title I of this Act. Sets forth specific requirements for such programs, allowing waivers in the case of any demonstration project which in the judgment of the Secretary of Health and Human Services is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of new SSA title XXI. Creates in the Treasury the Health Care Assurance Trust Fund to contain the savings resulting from this Act and other specified amounts for use in paying States operating subsidy and supplemental acute care benefits programs. Establishes a mechanism for financing such programs that is designed to be deficit neutral. Prohibits the use of funds appropriated to carry out new SSA title XXI to provide premium or cost-sharing assistance or supplemental acute care benefits under part B added below in connection with any abortion, except in cases where an abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother or where the pregnancy results from rape or incest. Title III: Medicaid Reforms - Subtitle A: Treatment of Acute Care Benefits for AFDC and Non-Cash Beneficiaries - Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to: (1) establish Medicaid rules for benefits for acute medical services for AFDC recipients and non-cash Medicaid beneficiaries; (2) provide for the division of acute medical service benefits into core benefits and supplemental acute care benefits; (3) limit the amount of Federal financial participation for benefits for acute medical services for AFDC recipient and non-cash Medicaid beneficiaries; (4) condition Federal financial participation on State maintenance-of-effort; and (5) provide for the continuation of State Medicaid eligibility categories. Subtitle B: Flexibility in Expenditures for Supplemental Benefits for AFDC and Non-Cash Beneficiaries - Amends new SSA title XXI to require each State to establish a State supplemental acute care benefits program. Subtitle C: Increased State Flexibility in Contracting for Coordinated Care - Amends SSA title XIX to modify Federal requirements to allow States more flexibility in contracting for coordinated care services. Subtitle D: Additional Medicaid Reforms - Amends SSA title XIX to make various specified changes providing for: (1) a reduction in the amount of payment adjustments for disproportionate share hospitals; (2) elimination of the medically needy program for individuals not in an institution; and (3) elimination of the Medicaid pediatric immunization program, and establishment of alternative delivery programs. Title IV: Access Improvements - Subtitle A: Expanding Access in Underserved Areas - Amends SSA title XI to provide for community health authorities demonstration projects for providing access to cost-effective preventive and primary care and related services for various areas and populations, including low-income residents of medically underserved areas or for medically underserved populations. Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary to make grants to migrant and community health centers for the development of health service networks for serving high impact areas, medically underserved areas, or medically underserved populations within the area they serve. Subtitle B: Improved Access in Rural Areas - Part 1: Grants to Encourage Community Rural Health Networks - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to an eligible State for the development of plans to increase access to health care services for residents of areas in the State designated as chronically underserved areas. Provides for technical assistance for entities establishing or enhancing a community rural health network in an underserved rural area. Provides financial assistance to entities to provide for the development and implementation of community rural health networks. Authorizes appropriations. Part 2: Incentives for Health Professionals to Practice in Rural Areas - Subpart A: National Health Service Corps Program - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude National Health Service Corps Loan Repayments from gross income.
