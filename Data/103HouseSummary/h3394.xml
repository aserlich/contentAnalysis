	<summary>
	10/27/1993--Introduced.
Applies the Freedom of Information Act to the legislative branch. Establishes the Disclosure Review Board in the legislative branch to decide complaints relating to disclosure of information withheld by a legislative agency. Requires Board members to be appointed by the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives and the minority and majority leaders of the Senate from among Federal retired administrative law judges. Authorizes a Board member to assess reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs incurred in any case in which the complainant substantially prevails under this Act against the United States. Requires the Board to designate one of its members to serve a one-year term as the Complaint Referral Officer. Requires such officer to appoint individuals to serve as Investigation Counsels to investigate and determine unresolved complaints received alleging failure by the legislative agency to make material available as required by this Act and to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that any such complaint is true. Requires the Investigation Counsel to meet U.S. magistrate qualifications.
