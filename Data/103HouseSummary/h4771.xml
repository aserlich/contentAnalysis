TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Legislative Accountability and Reform Title II: Regulatory Accountability and Reform Title III: Judicial Review Title IV: Baseline Study Federal Mandate Accountability and Reform Act of 1994 - Title I: Legislative Accountability and Reform - Requires each congressional committee of authorization to issue with every reported bill containing a Federal mandate an analysis of the fiscal impact of that mandate on State, local, and tribal governments, especially to the extent it: (1) imposes new enforceable duties; or (2) reduces or eliminates Federal financial assistance. (Sec. 102) Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to study and report on any proposed legislation establishing, amending, or reauthorizing any Federal program likely to have a significant budgetary impact on State, local, or tribal governments, especially any direct costs below or above $50 million threshold. Authorizes appropriations to CBO to conduct such studies. (Sec. 103) Provides for a point of order against any reported legislation unless it has a CBO Director report and either: (1) the direct costs of all Federal mandates in the legislation are estimated at less than $50 million in each of up to five fiscal years; or (2) the increase in authorization of appropriations under existing or for new Federal financial assistance programs provided by the legislation and usable by State, local, or tribal governments for mandate-subject activities is at least equal to the estimated direct costs of the mandates; and (3) the committee of jurisdiction has identified a reduction in authorization of existing appropriations, a reduction in direct spending, or an increase in receipts. Title II: Regulatory Accountability and Reform - Requires each agency to: (1) assess the effects of Federal regulations on State, local, and tribal governments, including the availability of resources to carry out any mandates in those regulations; and (2) seek to minimize those burdens that uniquely or significantly affect such governmental entities, consistent with achieving statutory and regulatory objectives. (Sec. 201) Directs each agency to develop an effective process to permit elected officials and other representatives of State, local, and tribal governments to provide meaningful and timely input in the development of regulatory proposals. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 202) Requires each agency to prepare a written statement of specified estimates before promulgating any notice of proposed rulemaking or final rule including Federal mandates that may result in aggregate State, local, or tribal expenditures of $100 million or more in any one year. (Sec. 203) Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to collect such statements and forward copies to the CBO Director. (Sec. 204) Requires the OMB Director to establish pilot programs in at least two agencies to test innovative and more flexible regulatory approaches that: (1) reduce reporting and compliance burdens on small governments; and (2) meet overall statutory goals and objectives. Title III: Judicial Review - Declares that any reports or statements prepared under this Act, any compliance or noncompliance with it, and any determination concerning its applicability shall not be subject to judicial review. Title IV: Baseline Study - Requires the Director of the Bureau of the Census to examine the measurement and definition issues involved in calculating the total costs and benefits to State, local, and tribal governments of compliance with Federal law. Requires such study to consider the feasibility of measuring indirect costs and benefits as well as the direct costs and benefits of the Federal, State, local, and tribal relationship. Authorizes appropriations.
