	<summary>
	3/9/1994--Introduced.
Prohibits providing Russia with foreign assistance for any fiscal year after FY 1995 unless the President certifies to the Congress for such fiscal year that: (1) the U.S. Government has received satisfactory assurances from the Government of Russia that Russia's intelligence activities in the United States are confined to routine, non-adversarial information gathering; (2) the Russian Government has concluded written agreements with the Governments of Latvia, Estonia, and Moldova on the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from those nations and is making progress toward fulfilling the agreements, is not pursuing policies in the former Yugoslavia that are contrary to U.S. and allied interests, and is committed to (and taking concrete steps toward) reforming the Russian economy along free-market lines; (3) Russian troops in the Kaliningrad region of Russia are respecting the sovereign territory of Lithuania and neighboring countries and are not offensively postured against any other countries; and (4) the activities of the Russian Government in the independent states of the former Soviet Union do not represent an attempt by Russia to diminish the sovereignty and independence of such States. Prohibits, with respect to FY 1995, providing foreign assistance to Russia unless the President certifies to the Congress for that fiscal year that the Russian Government has provided the U.S. Government with a full and accurate accounting of the espionage activities related to the Aldrich Ames case. Requires the President to report to the Congress for each fiscal year: (1) the amount, purpose, and effectiveness of foreign assistance provided to Russia for the preceding fiscal year; (2) a detailed accounting of the amount of foreign assistance appropriated which has not been expended and its status; and (3) an estimate of the total amount of capital exported from Russia during the previous fiscal year. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the U.S. Government should oppose all lending to Russia by the international financial institutions to which the United States is a member unless the Russian Government is in compliance with the conditions for assistance set forth by this Act.
