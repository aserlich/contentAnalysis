	11/22/1993--Introduced.
Attorney Accountability Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal judicial code to require the Federal courts to award reasonable attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant after the entry of a final judgment in any civil action, except where to do so would be against equity and good conscience. Authorizes the court, in an action involving multiple parties, to apportion the payment of such fees. Makes the provisions of this Act inapplicable to class action suits.
