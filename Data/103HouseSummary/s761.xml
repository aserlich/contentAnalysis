	<summary>
	6/8/1994--Passed Senate amended. Revises the definition of &quot;unit of general local government&quot; for purposes of Federal payments in lieu of taxes to include any organized or unorganized borough in Alaska. (Currently, such definition includes any borough existing in Alaska on October 20, 1976.) Defines the boundary of any Alaska unorganized borough as the same as the census area boundaries used by the Secretary of Commerce in the decennial census. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and transmit to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a study assessing whether units of government most directly affected by the loss of tax revenues, including but not limited to school districts, receive an equitable share of payments upon the expiration of Federal payments.
