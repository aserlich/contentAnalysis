Haitian Restoration of Democracy Act of 1994 - Supports the restoration of democracy in Haiti and the return to office of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the elected President of Haiti. Urges the President to: (1) facilitate the return to Haiti of a full contingent of human rights observers; and (2) subject to the request of Aristide, effect the deployment of a multinational border patrol between the Dominican Republic and Haiti to halt cross-border violations of sanctions against Haiti imposed by the United States and other countries. Supports multilateral socieconomic and peacekeeping assistance to Haiti upon the return to power of the democratically-elected President and the removal of Haiti's military high command. Prohibits any U.S. officer or employee from attempting to amend, reinterpret, or nullify the Governors Island Agreement (except with regard to the October 1993 deadline for the return to power of Aristide). Requires the President to notify the Haitian Government of the intention to terminate the bilateral migrant interdiction agreement effected in 1991. Prohibits the return to Haiti of any Haitian national or habitual resident without the individual's consent, unless the President determines, in a manner that incorporates procedural safeguards consistent with internationally endorsed standards, that such individual is not a refugee. Makes exceptions to such prohibition if an individual was involved in persecution of another person or is a felon who constitutes a danger to the United States. Imposes sanctions against Haiti, including prohibitions on: (1) credits or loans; (2) imports and exports; (3) contracts; and (4) air transport activities. Prohibits U.S. assistance to other countries that are not cooperating with sanctions against Haiti. Imposes sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act against such countries. Terminates sanctions when the President certifies to the Congress that the democratically-elected President has been reinstated and Haiti's military high command has met its obligations under the Governors Island Agreement. Grants eligible Haitians temporary protected status under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Excludes certain Haitians connected with the military, the military coup, and terrorist activities from admission into the United States. Blocks assets of such individuals that are in the United States.
