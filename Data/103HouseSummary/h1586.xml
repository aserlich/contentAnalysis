	<summary>
	4/1/1993--Introduced.
Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to eliminate the annual cap on the amount of payment for outpatient physical therapy and occupational therapy services under Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance). Revises the limitation on beneficiary liability for payment of any amounts billed in excess of the applicable limiting charge for physician services. Applies such limitation to nonparticipating suppliers and other persons, as well as nonparticipating physicians. Includes in the Secretary of Health and Human Services' annual explanation of Medicare benefits information on refunds of such amounts. Makes carriers responsible for determining, prior to making payment, whether the amount billed for services is in excess of the applicable limiting charge and, if so, notifying the physician or other providers as appropriate. Requires the reports to the Congress on changes in excess charges for physician services to reflect additional information on the services involved.
