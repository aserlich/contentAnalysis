	6/14/1994--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to pay the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada for their proportionate share of the tribal funds and annuities, plus interest, that arise under treaties between them and the United States that, but for the residence of the Nation in Canada and outside U.S. territorial limits, would have been compensable under the Indian Claims Commission Act.
