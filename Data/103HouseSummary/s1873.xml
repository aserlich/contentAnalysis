	2/25/1994--Introduced.
Interstate Transportation of Municipal and Industrial Waste Act of 1994 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize a State Governor, if requested by an affected local government and a local solid waste planning unit, to prohibit the disposal of out-of-State municipal and industrial waste in: (1) any landfill or incinerator in the State; and (2) landfill cells in landfills covered by exceptions under this Act that do not meet the State's design and location standards and leachate collection and groundwater monitoring requirements for new landfills. Permits such Governors, without the request of such entities, to limit the quantity of out-of-State municipal and industrial waste received for disposal, or the disposal of such waste, at landfills covered by exceptions under this Act. Prohibits discrimination against any particular landfill and against shipments of out-of-State waste on the basis of State of origin. Exempts from a Governor's authority to prohibit the disposal of out-of-State waste: (1) landfills that received documented shipments of such waste in 1992 and are in compliance with State laws relating to design and location standards, leachate collection, groundwater monitoring, and financial assurance for closure and post-closure and corrective action; (2) proposed landfills that, prior to January 1, 1994, received an approval from the affected local government to receive municipal and industrial waste generated outside of the county or State and a State notice of decision to grant a construction permit; or (3) incinerators that received documented shipments of such waste during 1992 and are in compliance with performance standards under the Clean Air Act and State laws relating to facility design and operations.
