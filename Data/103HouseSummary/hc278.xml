	<summary>
	8/5/1994--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) progress towards the fullest possible accounting for the Americans missing and unaccounted for remains central to our Nation's foreign policy toward Vietnam; (2) such accounting must remain the index by which further progress in relations must be judged; (3) the primary functions of the U.S. Government liaison office in Vietnam should be to facilitate accounting efforts and to establish a section to assist families and friends in their efforts to ascertain the status of their loved ones; and (4) the United States should support the process of nonviolent democratic reform in Vietnam and should increase its support for Voice of America programming in Vietnam.
