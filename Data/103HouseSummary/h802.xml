	<summary>
	2/3/1993--Introduced.
Deems a Vietnam era veteran who was held as a prisoner of war to be considered a socially and economically disadvantaged individual, thus permitting such individual to be included in a target group of minorities for which the Department of Defense seeks to obligate five percent of all procurement contracts during FY 1992 and 1993. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 to include small business concerns owned and controlled by Vietnam era veterans who were held as prisoners of war within those businesses eligible under the minority contract goal for defense procurement contract awards.
