	11/20/1993--Introduced.
Grants the Secretary of Agriculture authority to establish a temporary program to offer financial incentives to Forest Service employees in order to encourage them to voluntarily separate from the agency, whether by retirement or resignation, in order to avoid or minimize the need for involuntary separations. Provides for repayment of such incentives if the employee rejoins the Federal Government within a certain period of time. Limits total Forest Service outlays pursuant to the cooperative work trust funds accounts in FY 1994.
