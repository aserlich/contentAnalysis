	<summary>
	8/6/1993--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Congress supports the strict interpretation by the United States of the Missile Technology Control Regime (i.e., the policy statement announced on April 16, 1987 between the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, and Japan to restrict the transfer of missiles or equipment or technology that could contribute to the design, development, or production of missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction) concerning the inability to distinguish space launch vehicle technology from missile technology under the regime, and the inability to safeguard launch vehicle technology in a manner that would provide timely warning of its diversion to military purposes; and (2) the United States and the governments of other nations adhering to the Regime should be recognized for their success in restricting the export of space launch vehicle technology and of missile technology, and for the significant contribution made by the imposition of such restrictions in reducing the proliferation of missile technology capable of being used to deliver weapons of mass destruction.
