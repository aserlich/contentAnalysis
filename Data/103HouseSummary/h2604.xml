Requires the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, subject to appropriations, to make grants to the Center and authorizes the Director to enter into a long-term lease with the Port for Center use of Port wetlands property. Requires the University to make in-kind contributions for the Center and the Port to make Port property available for Center use. Authorizes appropriations.
