	<summary>
	8/22/1994--Reported to Senate amended. Fort Carson-Pinon Canyon Military Lands Withdrawal Act - Withdraws from appropriation under public land, mining, mineral, geothermal leasing, and mineral materials disposal laws, and reserves for military use by the Army, specified lands at the Fort Carson Military Reservation and Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site (both in Colorado). Requires the Secretary of the Army to manage such lands for military purposes covered by this Act and to authorize their use by other U.S. military agencies. Directs the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior, to develop a management plan for such reserved and withdrawn lands. Requires the Secretaries to enter into a memorandum of understanding to implement the plan. Terminates such land withdrawals and reservations 15 years after enactment of this Act, subject to extension under specified conditions. Requires the Secretary of the Army to: (1) decontaminate lands to be relinquished (but if such decontamination is not practicable or economically feasible, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to refuse to accept them); (2) warn the public of risks of entry, conduct only decontamination activities on such lands after the expiration of the withdrawal, and make a status report to the Secretary of the Interior and to the Congress; and (3) maintain a program of decontamination of the lands withdrawn by this Act at least at the level of effort carried out during FY 1992, subject to specified limitations. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to revoke withdrawal and reservation of such lands and accept jurisdiction over them if it is in the public interest to do so. Authorizes appropriations.
