Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to exempt a State, U.S. territory or possession, or the District of Columbia from compliance with such regulations if there are equally stringent regulations in effect.

Requires the NTSB to investigate such accidents and report on them to the same extent as U.S. civil aviation accidents.
