Private Security Officers Quality Assistance Act of 1993 - Conditions a State's eligibility for certain funds under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 on such State having in effect a program that satisfies the requirements of this Act and that preempts the laws of the political subdivisions of such State to the extent that they regulate private security services provided by security officers. Requires a State to have in effect requirements and procedures for issuing licenses to, and reviewing security services of, employers (including security contractors) and proprietary security managers. Sets forth restrictions regarding: (1) license fees; and (2) the assignment of private security officers. Sets forth requirements concerning: (1) preassignment screening; (2) private security officer training; (3) State issuance of registration permits to such officers; (4) waiver of preassignment screening and training requirements; (5) a grace period for issuance of new registration permits to such officers who hold current permits; (6) employee protection; (7) criminal charges made against such officers; and (8) penalties for violations of State requirements. Permits States to establish or maintain more stringent requirements than those under this Act.
