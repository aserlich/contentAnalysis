	4/21/1993--Introduced.
Declares that, for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, any qualified distribution made by a Native Corporation shall not be treated as a distribution made out of earnings and profits. Defines a qualified distribution as any distribution to a Native (as defined under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act) or descendant of a Native which: (1) is made after the date of enactment of such Act; and (2) but for this Act would have been treated as a dividend.
