Amends SSA title IV part F (Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program) to tie revised work supplementation and community work experience programs under such part to the new State programs established above under SSA title IV part A.

Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to pay such States amounts equal to such food stamp benefits. Title II: Expanded State Waiver Authority - Establishes an Interagency Waiver Request Board in order to provide a focal point within the Federal Government for the development and coordination of requests to waive specified provisions of various social welfare statutes to improve opportunities for low-income individuals and families to achieve self-sufficiency.
