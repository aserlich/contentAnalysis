	4/1/1993--Introduced.
Comprehensive Child Immunization Act of 1993 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate: (1) a list of vaccines that provide immunization against naturally occurring infectious diseases which are recommended for universal use in children; and (2) recommendations regarding the appropriate dosage and the ages of children at which each vaccine should be administered. Directs the Secretary to: (1) periodically purchase recommended childhood vaccines in amounts necessary for distribution to meet anticipated needs and for maintenance of a six-month reserve supply; and (2) negotiate a reasonable price for such vaccine. Requires a manufacturer of recommended childhood vaccine to provide costs or pricing data. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the confidentiality of such data; (2) the prohibition of additional shipping or handling charges; (3) multiple suppliers; and (4) reporting requirements. Directs the Secretary to provide for the distribution without charge of such vaccines to health care providers who serve children and meet other specified requirements. Permits a health care provider receiving a vaccine under such provisions to: (1) use such vaccine only for administration to children; and (2) impose a fee for the administration of the vaccine, but not for the vaccine itself, subject to specified limitations. Directs the Secretary to establish a national system to track the immunization status of children. Establishes in the Treasury a Comprehensive Child Immunization Account. Makes funds from such account available for vaccine purchases by the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to: (1) provide coverage of immunizations under early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and testing provisions of State Medicaid programs; and (2) require that payments to providers include reimbursement for administration of such vaccines. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) termination of the vaccine purchase program; (2) use of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund; (3) the permanent extension of authority to impose taxes for the Trust Fund; (4) the addition of vaccines to the vaccine injury table; (5) the extension of time for decision in proceedings on petitions for vaccine-related injuries or deaths; and (6) vaccine information materials (requiring a concise description of vaccine risks and benefits and a statement of program availability).
