	7/14/1994--Introduced.
Illegal Alien Prisoner Transfer and Border Enforcement Act of 1994 - Declares that the President should begin to negotiate and renegotiate bilateral prisoner transfer treaties. Requires the focus of such negotiations to be to: (1) expedite the transfer of aliens unlawfully in the United States who are incarcerated in U.S. prisons; (2) ensure that a transferred prisoner serves the balance of the sentence imposed by the U.S. courts; and (3) eliminate any requirement of prisoner consent to such a transfer. Directs the President to certify whether each prisoner transfer treaty is effective in returning aliens unlawfully in the United States who are incarcerated in the United States to their country of citizenship. Authorizes the enrollment of foreign border management personnel in Federal training and education programs and cooperative State programs to enhance the following U.S. law enforcement goals: (1) drug interdiction and other cross-border criminal activity; and (2) preventing illegal transit of people and goods.
