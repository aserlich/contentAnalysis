	<summary>
	9/21/1993--Passed House amended. Federal Employees Leave Sharing Amendments Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal Employees Leave Sharing Act of 1988 to repeal the termination of the Federal employee leave transfer and leave bank programs (thus making them permanent). Revises the definition of medical emergency under such programs to exclude any advanced leave from consideration in determining whether any paid leave is available to an employee. Allows an employee whose medical emergency has not terminated, but who has exhausted all transferred leave, to use any annual or sick leave accrued during the period of the medical emergency. Precludes any annual or sick leave accrued during the period of a medical emergency from being: (1) credited to an employee whose medical emergency terminates as a result of the employee's separation from service; or (2) used for any purpose by an employee whose medical emergency terminates for such reason. Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to prescribe regulations under which an employee participating in a leave bank program may also make or receive donations under a leave transfer program. Sets forth coordination rules for employee participation in both programs in connection with the same medical emergency. Repeals the demonstration project status of the leave bank program.
