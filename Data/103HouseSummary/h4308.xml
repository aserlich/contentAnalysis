	<summary>
	9/13/1994--Passed House amended. North American Wetlands Conservation Act Amendments of 1994 - Amends the North American Wetlands Conservation Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior, in 1998 (currently, 1991) and at five-year intervals thereafter, to undertake with the appropriate officials of Canada and Mexico to revise the goals and other elements of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. Requires the Secretary to develop: (1) a strategy to assist in conserving the full complement of North American wetlands systems and species dependent on such systems that incorporates existing information on types of wetlands habitats and species; and (2) procedures to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of wetlands conservation projects completed under the Act. Extends the authorization of appropriations to carry out the North American Wetlands Conservation Act through FY 1998. Amends the Partnerships for Wildlife Act to remove a condition on Federal funding for State wildlife conservation and appreciation projects which prohibits such funding from exceeding the State share of the cost of the project. Sets forth required State and private shares of the cost of such projects. Removes provisions which authorize donations from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to carry out such projects and which require the Foundation to donate a specified amount to the Wildlife Conservation and Appreciation Fund. Extends the authorization of appropriations to the Fund through FY 1998.
