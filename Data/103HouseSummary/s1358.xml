Limits judicial review to habeas corpus. Increases penalties for certain alien smuggling offenses. Extends penalties to persons who contract to bring in illegal labor. Treats smuggling as an aggravated felony. Title II: Asylum - Revises asylum procedures. Sets forth mandatory and discretionary conditions for granting provisional asylum. Establishes new application deadlines. States that asylum applications shall be determined by specially trained asylum officers. Terminates an alien's claim for failure to appear at the application hearing. Title III: Inspections - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish specified numbers of preinspection stations at foreign airports identified as last departure points for the greatest numbers of U.S.-arriving passengers and at those with the greatest numbers of U.S.-arriving undocumented aliens (and to assign additional immigration officers at such airports without preinspection stations); and (2) establish an expedited inspection process for U.S. citizens returning by air from abroad. Revises the pilot visa waiver program to: (1) make it permanent; (2) repeal certain paperwork requirements; (3) subject participants to exclusion or deportation without appeal (except for an asylum claim); and (4) require carriers to distribute program information to passengers. Provides for the training of airline personnel in detection of fraudulent documents.
