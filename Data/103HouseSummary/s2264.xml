	<summary>
	7/1/1994--Introduced.
Amends Federal transportation law to provide that the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), in approving an application of a rail carrier for the construction and operation of railroad lines, shall require that a fair and equitable arrangement for the protection of the affected railroad employees' interests be no less protective of and beneficial to their interests than those established under other specified Federal provisions. Prohibits the ICC from approving the sale or the offer of financial assistance to a rail carrier to avoid the abandonment and discontinuance of railroad line transportation unless it certifies that such employees' interests will be protected.
