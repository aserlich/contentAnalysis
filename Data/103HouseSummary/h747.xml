	<summary>
	2/2/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 to direct the Secretary of Defense, in making recommendations in 1993 and 1995 for the closure or realignment of U.S. military installations, to give the following considerations equal weight with other established criteria in the selection process: (1) equal allocation of the economic burden of such closures and realignments across the United States; (2) the effect on the economic conditions of communities located nearby; and (3) the extent to which additional closures or realignments would exacerbate adverse economic conditions of States and local communities already affected by a closure or realignment.
