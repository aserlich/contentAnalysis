	<summary>
	5/12/1994--Introduced.
Private Property Rights Act of 1994 - States that the Congress declares that it is the policy of the Federal Government to use all practicable means and measures to minimize Federal takings of private property. Directs Federal agencies to certify to the Attorney General that a private property taking impact analysis has been completed before initiating any action which could result in a taking or diminution of use or value of private property. Requires that the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies under this Act. Specifies the content of such an analysis and requires a copy to be transmitted to the owner of the affected property, as well as made available to the public. Creates a rebuttable presumption that unmodified analyses five years or older are outdated for purposes of any agency action or administrative or judicial proceeding. Sets the statute of limitations for court actions for enforcing this Act.
