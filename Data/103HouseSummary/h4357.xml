Provides for annual increases in that amount based on the percent change in the Consumer Price Index, effective January 1, 2000. (Sec. 102) Amends the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act to increase the period ( from 90 to 120 days) during which the court may continue a case in a civil action for deprivation of rights in order to require exhaustion of administrative remedies. Permits: (1) requiring exhaustion of remedies if the Attorney General has certified or the court has determined that such administrative remedies are fair and effective; (2) certification of grievance resolution systems for adults confined in correctional or pretrial detention facilities if such systems are fair and effective; and (3) the Attorney General to suspend or withdraw such certification at any time he has reasonable cause to believe the grievance procedure is no longer fair and effective. (Sec. 103) Amends the Federal judicial code to revise provisions regarding a bankruptcy judge's hearing of a proceeding related to a case under title 11. Specifies that if a party: (1) files a timely objection, the bankruptcy judge shall submit the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court, and any final order or judgment shall be entered by the district judge after considering the bankruptcy judge's proposed findings and conclusions and after reviewing de novo those matters to which any party has timely and specifically objected; and (2) does not file a timely objection, the party shall be deemed to consent to the findings and conclusions proposed by the bankruptcy judge, which shall become final, and the bankruptcy judge shall enter an appropriate order thereon. (Sec. 104) Amends the National Labor Relations Act to authorize the National Labor Relations Board, if any person violates a final order issued by the Board with respect to an unfair labor practice, to petition any U.S. district court in which the practice occurred, or in which such person resides or transacts business, for imposition of a monetary penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day such person violates the order. Grants the district courts jurisdiction to impose such penalty. (Sec. 105) Amends the Federal judicial code to require the chief judge of the Court of International Trade to be the judge of the court in regular active service who is senior in commission of those judges who: (1) are 64 years of age or under; (2) have served for one year or more as a judge of the court; and (3) have not served previously as chief judge. Sets forth provisions regarding the precedence of judges in acting as chief judge. (Sec. 106) Repeals provisions prohibiting increasing the salary of any Federal judge or Justice of the Supreme Court except as specifically authorized by Act of Congress. Title II: Judicial Financial Administration - Amends the Federal judicial code to provide that in FY 1993 and each fiscal year thereafter a specified amount shall be transferred annually to the judiciary into a special fund of the Treasury (special fund) for expenses incurred in: (1) adjudication of civil and criminal forfeiture proceedings that result in deposits into the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund (except the expense of salaries of judges); (2) representation of offenders whose assets have been seized in forfeiture proceedings to the extent that such expenses of representation could have been recovered through an order for payment or reimbursement of the Defender Services appropriation; and (3) supervision by U.S. probation officers of offenders under home detention or other forms of confinement outside of Bureau of Prisons facilities. Requires the amount transferred to be: (1) a portion of the total amount to be transferred from the combined fiscal year deposits into both the Fund and the Department of Treasury Asset Forfeiture Fund, which total shall not exceed the statement of costs incurred by the judiciary in providing such services, subject to specified requirements; and (2) paid from revenues deposited into the Fund during the fiscal year in which the expenses were incurred and are not required to be specified in appropriations Acts. (Sec. 202) Makes moneys in the Judiciary Automation Fund available to the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts without fiscal year limitation for the procurement of automatic data processing equipment for program activities included in the courts of appeals, district courts, and other judicial services accounts of the judicial branch. Permits: (1) the use of such Fund for support personnel in the courts and in the Administrative Office; and (2) all agencies of the judiciary to make deposits into such Fund to meet their automatic data processing needs. Terminates such Fund and authorities related to such Fund on September 30, 1999 (currently, 1994). Directs that all unobligated amounts remaining in such Fund on that date be deposited into the special fund (currently, the Judicial Services Account). (Sec. 203) Increases: (1) the fee for filing a civil action; and (2) the amount taken from such fees, or as part of a judgment for costs, to be deposited into the special fund. (Sec. 204) Provides that: (1) for FY 1994 and thereafter, of each fee collected for admission of an attorney to practice, $30 of that portion of the fee exceeding $20 shall be deposited into the special fund; and (2) any portion exceeding five dollars of the fee for a duplicate certificate of admission or certificate of good standing shall be deposited into the special fund. (Sec. 205) Directs that, upon an election by a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge, all of the accrued employer contributions and accrued interest on those contributions made on behalf of the bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund shall be transferred to the special fund, with exceptions. (Sec. 206) Provides that in every case in which the right to withdraw money deposited in court in pending and adjudicated cases has been adjudicated or is not in dispute and such money has remained so deposited and unclaimed for at least 90 days, the court shall cause such money to be transferred to the Director. Requires: (1) the Director to assume all fiduciary duties and responsibilities for such transferred money; (2) interest earned by such money while under the authorized control of the Director to be treated as interest earned on funds deposited in a court's registry; and (3) any charges collected by the judiciary for administering the funds to be deposited into the Registry Administration Account in the Treasury. (Sec. 207) Authorizes the Director, if necessary to develop and administer criterion referenced performance examinations for purposes of certification or other examinations for the selection of otherwise qualified interpreters, to prescribe for each examination a uniform fee.

Authorizes the magistrate judge, in a petty offense case involving a juvenile, to exercise powers granted to the district court. (Sec. 304) Prohibits a civil action in a State court from being removed to U.S. district court solely on the basis of concurrent jurisdiction over a claim under specified provisions of the Employment Retirement Security Act of 1974.
