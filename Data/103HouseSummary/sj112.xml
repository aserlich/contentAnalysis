	7/14/1993--Introduced.
Collective Security Participation Resolution - Urges the President to initiate discussions among the United Nations Security Council, General Assembly, and Military Staff Committee leading to negotiations of special agreements for international peace and security pursuant to the United Nations Charter and under which designated forces from various countries would be available for the Security Council. Affirms a commitment made to the General Assembly by President Bush to make bases and facilities available to the Security Council for multinational training of forces. Reaffirms that congressional approval of such an agreement will provide the President with full authority to direct the U.S. armed forces to be employed as necessary to support decisions of the Security Council.
