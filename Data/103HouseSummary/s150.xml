	<summary>
	6/16/1994--Passed Senate amended. Taliesin Preservation Act of 1994 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with the owner or operator of the Taliesin site (home of Frank Lloyd Wright from 1911 to 1959) in Wisconsin, pursuant to which the Secretary may mark, interpret, restore, and provide technical assistance for the preservation of the site. Requires such agreement to: (1) provide for public access to the site through conducted tours; and (2) prohibit any changes or alterations in the property except by mutual agreement. Conditions cooperative agreements and financial assistance under this Act on the owner or operator submitting a comprehensive plan for the continued preservation and public use of the site for the Secretary's approval. Authorizes appropriations. Prohibits the Secretary from providing more than one-third of the aggregate cost of implementing the cooperative agreements, with the remainder to be borne by State and private entities.
