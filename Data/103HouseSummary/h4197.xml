Provides that the defendant shall be subject to the death penalty if death results from the violent felony. (Sec. 102) Provides that any individual who is convicted of a Federal or State crime of violence shall, at the discretion of the court, be ineligible for any or all Federal benefits for up to five years upon a first conviction, up to ten years upon a second conviction, and permanently upon a third conviction. (Sec. 103) Amends the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 to eliminate judicial discretion in the denial of Federal benefits in cases of certain drug offenses. (Sec. 104) Provides for an enhanced penalty for the discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. (Sec. 105) Amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to provide for mandatory minimum prison sentences for those who sell illegal drugs to minors or who use minors in drug trafficking activities. (Sec. 106) Amends the Federal criminal code to require: (1) the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to establish a program of drug testing of criminal defendants on post-conviction release; and (2) the chief probation officer in each district to arrange for the drug testing of such defendants. Requires, as an explicit condition of probation, parole, or supervised release for a felony or a specified violent or drug offense, that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to periodic drug tests. (Sec. 107) Amends the Armed Career Criminal Act to include within the definition of &quot;serious drug offense&quot; an offense under State law which, if it had been prosecuted as a CSA violation at the time of the offense and because of the type and quantity of the controlled substance involved, would have been punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more. (Sec. 108) Sets mandatory penalties for firearms possession by persons previously convicted of a violent felony or a serious drug offense, and a mandatory minimum sentence for unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, fugitive from justice, or transferor or receiver of a stolen firearm. (Sec. 110) Increases: (1) the general penalty for violation of Federal firearms laws; and (2) enhanced penalties for possession of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. (Sec. 112) Sets penalties for smuggling firearms in aid of drug trafficking or violent crime. (Sec. 116) Establishes: (1) a temporary prohibition against possession of a firearm by, or transfer of a firearm to, persons convicted of a drug crime; and (2) enhanced penalties for possession of a firearm during a drug crime. Subtitle B: Capital Offenses - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for imposition of the death penalty for Federal crimes. Requires: (1) the Government, for any offense punishable by death, to serve notice upon the defendant that it intends to seek the death penalty and the aggravating factors upon which it will rely; and (2) the court to conduct a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court along upon motion by the defendant with the approval of the attorney for the Government, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense punishable by death and the attorney for the Government has met the notice requirements. Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, but permits evidence to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. Permits the Government to present information concerning the effect of the offense on the victim and the victim's family. Specifies mitigating and aggravating factors. Sets forth special aggravating factors for: (1) treason, espionage, homicide, and the attempted murder of the President; and (2) drug offenses punishable by the death penalty (such factors include previous serious drug felony convictions, use of a firearm in committing or furthering certain continuing criminal enterprises, use of minors in trafficking, and lethal adulteration of controlled substances). States that no person who was under age 18 at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. Requires the court to instruct the jury not to be influenced by prejudice or bias relating to the race, color, religion, national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim in considering whether to recommend a sentence of death. Sets forth procedures regarding imposition of, appeal from, and implementation of, a sentence of death. Prohibits: (1) a sentence of death from being carried out upon a person who lacks the mental capacity to understand the death penalty and why it was imposed on that person, or upon a woman while she is pregnant; and (2) requiring any employee of a State department of corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals Service, or any person providing services to that department, bureau, or service under contract to be in attendance or to participate in any execution if such participation is contrary to such person's moral or religious convictions. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) appointment of counsel; (2) deadlines for collateral attacks on judgments imposing a sentence of death; and (3) stays of execution. Limits the circumstances under which a person subject to the criminal jurisdiction of an Indian tribal government may be executed under this subtitle. (Sec. 122) Declares that the death penalty and all other penalties shall be administered by the United States and by every State without regard to the race or color of the defendant or victim, and that neither the United States nor any State shall prescribe any racial quota or statistical test for the imposition or execution of the death penalty or any other penalty. (Sec. 123) Specifies that, in a prosecution for an offense against the United States for which a sentence of death is authorized, the fact that the killing of the victim was motivated by racial prejudice or bias shall be deemed an aggravating factor whose existence permits consideration of the death penalty, in addition to any other aggravating factors that may be specified by law as permitting consideration of the death penalty. (Sec. 124) Extends the protection of civil rights provisions regarding conspiracy against rights and deprivation of rights under color of law to cover persons in (currently, limited to inhabitants of) any State, territory, or district. (Sec. 125) Provides for imposition of the death penalty for specified Federal crimes, including: (1) murders committed by prisoners while confined in a Federal prison; (2) murder of Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers; (3) homicides and attempted homicides involving firearms in Federal facilities; (4) civil rights murders; (5) gun murders; (6) murder by escaped prisoners; (7) torture, where death results, subject to specified limitations; (8) carjacking resulting in death; (9) genocide; and (10) specified drug-related offenses, committed as part of a continuing criminal enterprise. Subtitle C: Enhanced Penalties for Criminal Use of Firearms and Explosives - Chapter 1: Instant Check System for Handgun Purchases - Provides for the establishment of a system for identifying felons and persons adjudicated mentally incompetent. Requires the Attorney General of the United States to create a national, computerized list of prohibited persons, incorporate State criminal history records into the Federal criminal records systems maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), develop hardware and software systems to link State lists with the national list, and provide any responsible State agency with access to the national list, upon request. Directs teach State to create and maintain a computerized list of all persons who are prohibited persons by reason of a conviction or adjudication in the State and, within two years, achieve and maintain at least 80 percent currency of case dispositions in the computerized list for all cases in which there has been an entry of activity within the immediately preceding five years. Requires the State transportation agency, before issuing, reissuing, or reinstating a license, to: (1) conduct a record check to determine whether the applicant is a prohibited person; and (2) affix to the license of the person a magnetic strip on which is encoded information to identify such a person. Provides for the seizure and voiding of a driver's license upon a felony conviction or adjudication of mental incompetency. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the funding of records checks; (2) procedures for correcting erroneous records; and (3) judicial review. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) to reduce by 25 percent the annual allocation to a State for a fiscal year under title I (drug control and system improvement grant program) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Omnibus Act) for States with a waiting period or a system for identifying felons before the purchase of a handgun not meeting specified requirements. (Sec. 133) Prohibits a licensed firearms dealer from knowingly selling a handgun to an unlicensed individual without reading the magnetic strip, or failing to notify local law enforcement authorities within 72 hours of any person attempting to purchase a handgun who is identified as a prohibited person through the use of such a device. Sets penalties for violations. Chapter 2: Other Firearms Provisions - Increases penalties for: (1) interstate gun trafficking; (2) making knowingly false, material statements in connection with the purchase of a firearm from a licensed dealer; and (3) a second offense of using an explosive to commit a felony. (Sec. 142) Prohibits: (1) transactions involving stolen firearms which have moved in interstate or foreign commerce; (2) the receipt of firearms by non-residents of the State in which the transferor resides, unless such receipt is for lawful sporting purposes; (3) the possession of explosives by felons and others; and (4) the possession of explosives during the commission of a felony. (Sec. 145) Provides for mandatory revocation of supervised release for possession of a firearm in violation of a condition of release. (Sec. 156) Authorizes the summary destruction of explosives subject to forfeiture under specified circumstances. Subtitle D: Miscellaneous - Increases penalties for Travel Act crimes involving racketeering and conspiracy to commit contract killings. (Sec. 162) Makes it a criminal offense to fail to obey an order to land an aircraft issued by an authorized Federal law enforcement officer under specified circumstances.

Title II: Equal Protection for Victims - Subtitle A: Victims' Rights - Enacts Rules of Professional Conduct for Lawyers in Federal Practice, including provisions regarding: (1) a prohibition on attorneys engaging in actions deemed abusive to clients or others; (2) a duty of enquiry (to elicit from the client a truthful account of the material facts concerning the matters in issue); (3) a duty to expedite litigation; and (4) a duty to disclose information necessary to prevent the commission of a crime. (Sec. 202) Revises Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure: (1) 24(b) to entitle each side to six peremptory challenges (currently, six for the Government and ten for the defendant or defendants jointly); and (2) 32 to provide for a victim's right of allocution in sentencing for a crime of violence or sexual abuse. (Sec. 204) Provides for the enforcement of restitution orders through the suspension of Federal benefits. (Sec. 205) Sets penalties for retaliatory killings of witnesses, victims, and informants. Subtitle B: Judicial Reform - Amends the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) to allow evidence of similar offenses in criminal or civil sexual assault and child molestation cases. (Sec. 212) Revises FRE 412 (sex offense cases; relevance of victim's past behavior) to: (1) expand the scope of the rape shield law and to require that an order admitting evidence of a victim's past sexual behavior explain the reasoning leading to a finding of relevance and the basis of a finding that the probative value of the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice; and (2) make inadmissible evidence to show invitation or provocation by a victim in sexual abuse cases. (Sec. 214) Specifies that evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure shall not be excluded on the ground that the search or seizure was in violation of the fourth amendment to the Constitution if carried out in circumstances justifying an objectively reasonable belief that it was in conformity with the fourth amendment. (Sec. 215) Provides that in a criminal trial in any Federal or State court: (1) on motion of the defense attorney or prosecutor, the risk of racial prejudice or bias shall be examined on voir dire if there is a substantial likelihood that such prejudice will affect the jury; (2) on motion of the defense attorney or prosecutor, a change of venue shall be granted if an impartial jury cannot be obtained in the original venue because of such prejudice; and (3) neither the prosecutor nor the defense attorney shall make any appeal to such prejudice in statements before the jury. (Sec. 216) Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that a list of veniremen and witnesses need not be furnished in capital cases if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that providing the list may jeopardize the life or safety of any person. (Sec. 217) Increases penalties for attempting to influence or injure court officers or jurors. (Sec. 218) Provides for imposition of the death penalty for the murder of a Federal witness. (Sec. 219) Requires (current law authorizes) the court to order restitution of the victim when a convicted defendant is being sentenced for specified offenses. Authorizes a court to order restitution of any person who, as shown by a preponderance of the evidence, was harmed physically, emotionally, or pecuniarily by unlawful conduct of the defendant during the offense or during the course of a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of unlawful activity related to the offense. Directs the court: (1) to order restitution in the full amount of the victim's losses without consideration of the economic circumstances of the offender or the fact that a victim is entitled to receive compensation from insurance or any other source; and (2) upon determination of the amount owed to each victim, to specify in the restitution order the manner of, and schedule for, restitution in consideration of the financial resources and other assets, projected earnings and other income, and financial obligations of the offender. Specifies that: (1) a restoration order may direct the offender to make a single, lump-sum payment, partial payments at specified intervals, or such in-kind payments as may be agreeable to the victim and the offender; and (2) such in-kind payments may be in the form of the return or replacement of property or services rendered to the victim or another person or organization. Provides that when the court finds that more than one: (1) offender has contributed to the loss of a victim, the court may make each offender liable for payment of the full amount or may apportion liability among the offenders to reflect the level of contribution and economic circumstances of each offender; and (2) victim has sustained a loss requiring restitution by an offender, the court shall order full restitution of each victim but provide for different payment schedules to reflect the economic circumstances of each victim. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) compensation with respect to losses from insurance or other sources; (2) set-offs against amounts later recovered as compensatory damages by the victim in Federal and State civil proceedings; and (3) payment by the offender to the clerk of the court for accounting and payment in accordance with this section. Specifies that a restitution order shall constitute a lien against all property of the offender. Makes compliance with a restitution order a condition of any probation, parole, or other form of release of an offender. Specifies actions the court may take, including revocation of probation or supervised release, if a defendant fails to comply. Provides for enforcement of restitution orders. Authorizes: (1) a victim or offender to petition the court to modify a restitution order in view of a change in the economic circumstances of the offender; and (2) the court to refer any issue arising in connection with a proposed restitution order to a magistrate or special master for proposed findings of fact and recommendations as to disposition, subject to a de novo determination of the issue by the court. Title III: Protecting Families and Communities - Subtitle A: Safe Neighborhoods - Amends the CSA to increase penalties for drug trafficking in or near schools. (Sec. 302) Authorizes: (1) a school district to elect to qualify as a Federal safe school district by decision of a local educational agency or by referendum of the voters in a school district served by such an agency; and (2) the Attorney General to make grants to local educational agencies or local law enforcement agencies of Federal safe school districts to pay for enhanced school security measures. (Sec. 303) Amends the Omnibus Act to authorize the Director of the BJA to make grants to local governments and community groups to increase the police presence in communities.
