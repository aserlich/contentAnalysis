	1/5/1993--Introduced.
Requires the President to seek negotiations with the Japanese Government to reach an agreement requiring the Japanese Government to pay to the United States an annual security fee equal to three percent of the Japanese annual gross national product less the amount actually spent by the Japanese Government for defense for the preceding year. Requires the President, within one year, to notify the Congress whether such agreement has been reached. Provides that the Congress should consider legislation imposing import duties on Japanese products to generate revenues equal to such fee if no such agreement has been reached or the agreement reached does not satisfy requirements of this Act.
