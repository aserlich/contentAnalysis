Pension Reform Act of 1993 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) with respect to pension integration, participation, and vesting requirements. Extends applicability of new integration rules under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to all existing accrued benefits. Amends the IRC to disallow integration for simplified employee pensions, by repealing provisions relating to permitted disparity under rules limiting discrimination under simplified employee pensions.

Revises IRC minimum coverage requirements with respect to separate lines of business. Sets forth a special rule where the employer operates a single line of business. Limits a line of business exception. Eliminates a special vesting rule for multiemployer plans under IRC and ERISA. Provides for division of pension benefits upon divorce unless otherwise provided in qualified domestic relations orders. Provides for the continued availability of remedies relating to rights of spouses to accrued benefits under pension plans under divorce case domestic relations orders entered before 1985.
