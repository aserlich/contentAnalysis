	7/30/1993--Introduced.
Civil Rules Amendments Act of 1993 - Permits the proposed amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which are embraced by an order entered by the Supreme Court on April 22, 1993, to take effect on December 1, 1993, with the following amendments. Amends proposed rule 26 to: (1) repeal certain requirements regarding initial disclosures by parties; and (2) permit a party to obtain discovery of the existence and contents of any insurance agreement under which any person carrying on an insurance business may be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment which may be entered in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment. Specifies that: (1) information concerning the insurance agreement is not by reason of disclosure admissible in evidence at trial; and (2) an application for insurance shall not be treated as part of an insurance agreement for purposes of such provision. Amends proposed rule 30 to provide that, unless the court upon motion orders, or the parties agree in writing to use, sound or sound-and-visual means, depositions shall be recorded by stenographic means. Amends proposed form 35 to repeal provisions regarding pre-discovery disclosures.
