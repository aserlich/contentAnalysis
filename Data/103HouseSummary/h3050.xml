	<summary>
	8/8/1994--Passed House amended. Amends the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area Establishment Act of 1990 to expand the boundaries of the Area. Extends the deadline for the Secretary of the Interior to develop the management plan for the Area until January 1, 1997. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer to the owner of the Old Nevada recreation facility certain Federal lands within the Area which, on March 1, 1994, were used to provide parking for visitors to such facility, in exchange for lands of equal or greater value within the Area. Requires the priority date for the reserved water rights associated with lands added to the Area after November 16, 1990, to be the date of the enactment of the Act adding such lands to the Area. Withdraws lands depicted on the map entitled &quot;Potential Conservation Lands: Possible Hydroelectric Project&quot; from all public land, mining, and mineral and geothermal leasing laws. Declares that nothing in this Act shall limit the issuance of any necessary licenses or public land rights-of-way for any hydroelectric project involving such lands. Adds such lands to the Area five years after the enactment of this Act, unless before such date all necessary licenses and public land rights-of-way have been issued for a hydroelectric project involving some or all of the lands. Permits the Austin Historic Mining District Historical Society to use certain lands in Austin, Nevada, for 20 years for a museum or other facility to illustrate the history of the District.
