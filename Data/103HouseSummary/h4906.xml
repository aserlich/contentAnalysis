	8/17/1994--Passed House amended. Emergency Spending Control Act of 1994 - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to prohibit the Office of Management and Budget from exempting emergency funding from spending caps if such spending is in a measure with nonemergency spending. Amends the Congressional Budget Act to make it out of order in the House or Senate to consider emergency legislation if it also provides for spending for any other item or contains any other matter. Allows such legislation to contain rescissions of budget authority, reductions of direct spending, or amendments to reduce amounts for the emergency.
