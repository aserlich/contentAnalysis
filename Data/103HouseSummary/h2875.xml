Department of Energy National Competitiveness Technology Partnership Act of 1993 - Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to authorize the Secretary of Energy and the directors of departmental laboratories (laboratories operated by or on behalf of the Department of Energy (DOE) or facilities that would be considered to be laboratories under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980) to enter into partnerships that enhance the economic, scientific, or technological competitiveness of U.S. industry. Directs the Secretary to develop a multi-year critical technology strategy. Authorizes the Secretary and the directors of departmental laboratories to enter into partnerships that build on the core competencies of the laboratories to conduct research, development, demonstration, or commercial application activities in nuclear energy, energy efficiency or supply, high-performance computing, the environment, human health, advanced manufacturing technologies, advanced materials, transportation, space, or quality technologies, or technologies listed in the annual defense critical technologies plan. Requires the Secretary to establish: (1) a Laboratory Partnership Advisory Board within DOE; and (2) a program to encourage scientists and engineers from departmental laboratories to serve as visiting fellows in the research facilities of governments, educational institutions, and industrial organizations in the United States and foreign countries. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on opportunities for minority colleges and universities to participate in DOE or departmental laboratory programs. Requires the Secretary to establish a career path program to recruit employees of the national laboratories to serve in DOE positions. Amends the Federal criminal code and the Federal Procurement Policy Act to make certain post-employment restrictions inapplicable with respect to the national laboratories. Amends the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 to provide for cooperative projects involving DOE or DOE laboratories and non-Federal entities to test and apply high-performance computing and high-speed networking technologies. Authorizes appropriations. Increases the number of DOE Under Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries. Authorizes appropriations.
