	4/7/1993--Introduced.
Negotiated Rate Amendments of 1993 - Makes it an unreasonable practice for a nonhousehold goods motor carrier, a nonhousehold goods freight forwarder, or a person representing one or the other to attempt to charge or to charge for a transportation service the difference between the lawfully filed tariff rate and the negotiated rate for such transportation, if the carrier or freight forwarder is no longer transporting property or is transporting property for the purpose of avoiding application of this Act. Grants the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) exclusive jurisdiction to make determinations with respect to unreasonableness. Shortens the statute of limitations for the filing of claims by: (1) a motor common carrier for recovery of transportation or service charges; and (2) a person to recover overcharges by a motor carrier. Decreases the limitation period for both kinds of claims from 36 months to: (1) 24 months for claim accruals during the year following enactment on this Act; and (2) 18 months for claim accruals on or after one year following enactment. Permits motor carriers and shippers to resolve by mutual consent, subject to Commission review and approval, any overcharge and undercharge claims resulting from billing errors or incorrect tariff provisions arising from the inadvertent failure to properly and timely file and maintain agreed upon rates, rules, or classifications. Prohibits any tariff filed with the ICC from being held invalid solely on the basis that it uses a numerical or alpha account code to designate customers or describe the applicability of rates.
