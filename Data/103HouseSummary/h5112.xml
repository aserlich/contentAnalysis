	9/27/1994--Introduced.
Amends the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) to require persons who are engaged in the business of reselling telephone toll service to disclose: (1) the identity of the common carriers whose facilities the resellers use; and (2) the nature of the reseller's affiliation with such carrier. Requires the reseller to make such disclosures in: (1) advertisements or solicitations offering such service; (2) writing within ten days before authorizing providers of telephone exchange services to alter connections for the provision of telephone toll service; and (3) within ten days after any change in the identity of the carrier whose facilities such reseller uses or in any other information required to be disclosed. Provides that resellers who violate this Act: (1) shall be subject to the same penalties and forfeitures that are available under the Act with respect to a violation by a carrier; and (2) may be ordered by the Federal Communications Commission or a State commission to pay the expenses of persons affected by such violation in obtaining reconnection to another reseller or carrier.
