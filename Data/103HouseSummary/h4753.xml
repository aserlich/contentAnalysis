Professional Boxing Safety Act - Allows a professional boxing match to be held in the United States only if: (1) the State where the professional boxing match is to be held has a State boxing commission or has entered into an agreement with a State boxing commission of another State to oversee the match and to regulate each of its boxing matches; and (2) the State boxing commission has established procedures to carry out this Act. Requires each professional boxer to register with: (1) the State boxing commission of the State in which such boxer resides; (2) the State boxing commission overseeing the boxing match if the boxer is a resident of a State in which there is no State boxing commission; and (3) any State that has a State boxing commission if the boxer is from a foreign country. Requires a State boxing commission to issue an identification card to each registered professional boxer to be renewed by the boxer at least once every three years and to be presented to the State boxing commission by the time of the weigh-in for a professional boxing match. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed as preventing a State from applying additional registration requirements. Requires each State boxing commission to: (1) establish procedures to evaluate the professional records of each boxer participating in a boxing match in the State; and (2) ensure that no boxer is permitted to box while under suspension from any State boxing commission for any reason. Requires the results of a professional boxing match and the suspension of a boxer, promoter, or manager ordered by a State boxing commission to be reported to the professional boxing registries certified by the Association of Boxing Commissioners and to the Florida State Athletic Commission within 48 business hours after the conclusion of such match or the suspension of such individuals. Authorizes the U.S. Attorney to bring a civil action in U.S. district court requesting relief to restrain a person or entity from continuing to engage in, or to sanction, a professional boxing match in violation of this Act. Imposes criminal penalties on managers, promoters, or professional boxers who knowingly and willfully violate this Act.
