	11/3/1993--Passed House amended. Amends the Federal criminal code to direct the Bureau of Prisons to provide residential substance abuse treatment for not less than 50 percent of eligible prisoners by the end of FY 1995, for not less than 75 percent by the end of FY 1996, and for all eligible prisoners by the end of 1997 and thereafter. Grants priority for such treatment based on an eligible prisoner's proximity to release date. Permits sentence reductions of up to a year for a prisoner's successful completion of a residential substance abuse treatment program. Requires the Bureau to transmit to specified congressional committees annual reports describing each substance abuse treatment program operated by the Bureau, how program eligibility is determined, and Bureau compliance with the requirements of this Act. Authorizes appropriations.
