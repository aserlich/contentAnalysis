	<summary>
	9/23/1993--Introduced.
Calls on the President to direct the U.S. Representative to the United Nations (UN) to: (1) urge the UN to begin formal investigations into violations of international law that have been committed in the former Yugoslavia since 1991; (2) encourage the UN Commission of Experts to begin using funds earmarked for such investigations by immediately sending teams of investigators to locations in Germany, Austria, Denmark, France, Croatia, Kosovo, and Serbia, where thousands of victims of war crimes are residing; and (3) urge the UN, by October 6, 1993, to appoint a prosecutor for the International Tribunal to continue and expand such investigations and to prosecute persons responsible for such violations. Encourages the President to provide, on temporary assignment to the Commission or to the prosecutor, Federal personnel who have experience working with victims of rape and other heinous crimes to interview such victims and to gather legal evidence relating to such crimes. Requests the President to work with the UN to establish a time schedule for aggressive prosecution of persons responsible. Calls on the UN Security Council to withhold consideration of lifting the economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) until all indictments against those persons ultimately responsible for such violations have been issued by the International Tribunal and such persons have surrendered for trial.
