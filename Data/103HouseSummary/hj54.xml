Requires a two-thirds roll call vote of each House to increase the public debt. Directs the President to submit a balanced budget to the Congress. Requires a two-thirds roll call vote of the total membership of each House before any bill to increase revenue may become law. Waives these provisions when a declaration of war is in effect.
