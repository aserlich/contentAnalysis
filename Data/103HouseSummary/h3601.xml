	<summary>
	11/20/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, with the concurrence of a State, to issue a discharge permit that modifies certain requirements with respect to total suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand in the effluent discharged from a publicly owned treatment works into open coastal marine waters if the applicant demonstrates that: (1) such discharge is at a depth exceeding 300 feet and meets all other requirements with regard to impacts on the marine environment; (2) the effluent has received chemically enhanced primary treatment and meets all State requirements; and (3) the applicant is implementing a water reclamation and reuse program that will result in a steady reduction in the equivalent concentration of total suspended solids discharged into the marine environment and will be cost-effective and not result in sewer and water rates in the affected service area that are more than two percent of the median family income in such area.
