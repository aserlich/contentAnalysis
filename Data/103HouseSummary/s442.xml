Indian Dams Safety Act of 1993 - Establishes a dam safety operation and maintenance program (program) within the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) develop a comprehensive list of dams located on Indian lands in New Mexico that are in fair, conditionally poor, poor, or unsatisfactory condition; and (2) perform such rehabilitation work as is necessary to bring such dams to a satisfactory condition. Requires that the dam, upon completion of rehabilitation work, be placed under the program and be regularly maintained pursuant to program guidelines. Specifies that work authorized by this Act shall be for the purposes of dam safety operation and maintenance and not to provide additional conservation storage capacity or to develop benefits beyond those provided by the original dams and reservoirs.
