	<summary>
	4/22/1993--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Secretary of State should identify the foreign countries that either do not have effective laws protecting the local environment from polluting and environmentally destructive industrial and agricultural practices or do not adequately and constructively enforce the laws; and (2) the President should enter into international agreements with such countries to promote the development and enforcement of such laws and to improve the mechanisms under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to provide a more expeditious response to complaints regarding the environmental practices of participating countries.
