	1/21/1993--Introduced.
Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1993 - Amends title VII (Equal Employment Opportunities) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make it an unlawful employment practice to grant preferential treatment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, except: (1) under existing provisions involving bona fide occupational qualifications and religion, sex, or national origin or involving employment by a religious educational institution; or (2) in recruiting applicants. (Current law, that would be replaced by this Act, declares that nothing in that title shall be interpreted to require preferential treatment on such basis on account of an imbalance in numbers or percentages.)
