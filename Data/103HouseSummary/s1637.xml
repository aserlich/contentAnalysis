Title II: Improve Minerals Management Service Royalty Collection - Requires the Secretary to direct the Minerals Management Service, Royalty Management Program, to develop and implement: (1) an automated business information system to provide its auditors a lease history; (2) optimum methods to identify and resolve anomalies and to verify royalty payments; (3) new royalty compliance and enforcement measures; and (4) other actions necessary to reduce royalty underpayment and increase revenues by a specified amount. Amends the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 to authorize the Secretary to assess a penalty of ten percent of the amount of underreported royalty, and 20 percent of the amount of substantially underreported royalty. Title III: Phase Out the Mineral Institute Program - Directs the Secretary to phase out the Mining and Mineral Resources Research Institute Act of 1984 by the end of FY 1998.
