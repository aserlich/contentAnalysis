TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Airline Competition Enhancement Title II: Airline Passenger Protection Airline Competition Enhancement and Passenger Protection Act of 1993 - Title I: Airline Competition Enhancement - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to prohibit air carriers, without approval of the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary), from transferring: (1) a certificate authorizing the carrier to engage in foreign air transportation (or any portion of such certificate); or (2) in any one-year period period ten or more of the slots allocated at a high density airport. Directs the Secretary to establish transfer procedures. Sets forth approval criteria. Authorizes foreign persons to purchase more than a specified percentage of the voting interests of a U.S. air carrier under certain conditions. Title II: Airline Passenger Protection - Requires air carriers that provide air transportation between the same locations as air carriers that become debtors under the bankruptcy laws to provide, on a space available basis, air transportation for persons holding airline tickets sold by the debtor air carrier. Requires the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to consider: (1) methods of ensuring that each air carrier provides enough seats for persons redeeming frequent flyer awards; (2) requirements to ensure that such air carrier give members of its frequent flyer program adequate notice of material changes in such program; and (3) whether or not frequent flyer mileage obtained under one air carrier's frequent flyer program should be transferable to another air carrier's frequent flyer program as a means of reducing the anticompetitive effects of such program.
