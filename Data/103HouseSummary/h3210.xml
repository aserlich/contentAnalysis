(Sec. 213) Requires the Council to develop and certify (subject to Panel review and approval) voluntary national standards for content areas, student performance, and fair opportunity-to-learn.

(Sec. 218) Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make a competitive grant to a consortium of various individuals and organizations to develop voluntary national opportunity-to-learn standards. (Sec. 219) Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to applicant States and local educational agencies (LEAs) to help defray costs of developing, field testing, and evaluating systems of assessments aligned to Council-certified State content standards.

(Sec. 309) Requires State education agencies (SEAs) to make competitive subgrants for: (1) local reform, to LEAs; and (2) preservice teacher education and professional development activities, to consortia of LEAs, higher education institutions, private nonprofit organizations, or combinations of these, through a peer-review process. Requires that at least 50 percent of local reform subgrants be awarded to LEAs with a greater percentage or number of disadvantaged children than the statewide average. (Sec. 310) Provides for availability of systemic reform information and training to private elementary and secondary schools and teachers. (Sec. 311) Authorizes the Secretary to waive requirements and related regulations of specified Federal laws relating to education upon request of SEAs, LEAs, and schools if such requirements impede their ability to carry out the State or local education improvement plans, and if other conditions are met. (Sec. 313) Authorizes the Secretary to provide for national leadership activities, including technical assistance, data gathering, research, evaluation, and information dissemination. Reserves funds for grants to urban and rural LEAs with large numbers of concentrations of students economically disadvantaged or with limited English proficiency, to assist in school improvement plans development and implementation.

Title VI: Parental Information and Resource Centers - (Sec. 601) Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make annual grants to private, nonprofit organizations to provide training and information to parents of children enrolled in participating schools and individuals who work with such parents to encourage a more effective working relationship with professionals in meeting the educational needs of such children.
