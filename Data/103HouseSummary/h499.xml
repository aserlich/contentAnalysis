	1/21/1993--Introduced.
Universal Voter Registration Act of 1993 - Requires States to establish procedures with respect to presidential and congressional elections to permit voter registration by: (1) application in person simultaneously with application for a motor vehicle driver's license; (2) mail application; or (3) application in person at designated Federal, State, or nongovernmental office locations. Declares that this Act does not apply to any State that has no voter registration requirement with respect to Federal elections, or in which voters may register at the polling place at the time of a general election for Federal office. Amends Federal postal rate law to require the Postal Service to make certain lower postal rates available to State or local election officials who certify that a mailing is in furtherance of this Act. Directs the Federal Election Commission to develop a mail voter registration application form for Federal elections. Provides a private right of action for an individual aggrieved by a violation of this Act. Imposes criminal penalties for specified violations of this Act.
