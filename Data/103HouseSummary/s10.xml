Flexible Family Leave Tax Credit Act of 1993 - Title I: Family Leave Credit - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an employer an income tax credit for 20 percent of qualified employee compensation with respect to an employee who is on family leave. Limits such credit to employers with 500 or fewer employees, the amount of qualified compensation, and the maximum period for the use of such leave. Provides that employees qualify for such program if they have no unused sick, disability, or similar leave. Title II: Deficit Neutral Revenue Offset - Increases corporate estimated tax payments for corporations that do not use the previous year's liability safe harbor. Modifies the rules for income annualization for such tax payments.
