Title V: Task Force, Advisory Council, and Studies - Establishes a two-year interagency Flood Insurance Task Force to: (1) develop standardized flood insurance enforcement procedures; (2) study Federal agency and secondary mortgage market assistance with respect to such enforcement; and (3) study the possibility of existing Federal and corporate flood insurance programs as models for new programs. Establishes the Technical Mapping Advisory Council to undertake certain activities with respect to the preparation, dissemination, and use of flood insurance rate maps. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the FEMA Director to report to the Congress on whether it would be feasible for the national flood insurance program to be administered by the private insurance industry, as well as on such industry's impact on the availability and affordability of flood insurance. Title VI: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to: (1) increase flood insurance coverage amounts for nonresidential, single family, and multifamily structures; (2) allow additional coverage for compliance with land use and control measures; (3) permit flood insurance private sector participation; and (4) require an assessment (and revision if necessary) of flood insurance maps (with identification of erosion hazard areas) at least every five years.
