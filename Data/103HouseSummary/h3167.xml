	11/21/1993--Conference report filed in House, 2nd conference report. Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1993 - Amends the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991 to extend to February 5, 1994, the authorization for new claims for benefits under the emergency unemployment compensation (EUC) program. Reduces the number of benefit weeks available during such extended period after October 2, 1993, to seven or 13, as applicable. Modifies the final phase-out period for continuation of claims. Repeals provisions which allow certain claimants who have exhausted benefits to choose EUC benefits in lieu of regular State benefits at the beginning of a new benefit year. Amends the Social Security Act to require the State agency administering the State unemployment law to establish and use a system of worker profiling of all new claimants for regular compensation to: (1) identify which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular compensation and will need job search assistance services; (2) refer identified claimants to reemployment services available under State or Federal law; and (3) collect follow-up information on such services and employment outcomes. Directs the Secretary of Labor to report to the Congress on such profiling system. Makes a technical amendment to Unemployment Trust Fund provisions. Extends a reporting date for an advisory council on unemployment compensation. Provides for a temporary increase in the sponsorship period for aliens under the supplemental security income program. Provides for an extension of the program of emergency unemployment compensation benefits for railroad workers.
