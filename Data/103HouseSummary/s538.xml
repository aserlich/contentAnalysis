	3/9/1993--Introduced.
Long-Term Care Insurance Consumer Protection Act of 1993 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to afford Federal consumer protection to purchasers of long-term care insurance policies by requiring that before such policies may be issued or sold they must have been either certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as meeting the minimum Federal standards and requirements established by this Act or approved under a State regulatory program. Requires the Secretary to promulgate such standards incorporating the requirements of this Act, unless the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) does so first. Outlines requirements for State regulatory programs. Provides for regulation of the marketing of long-term care insurance policies by establishing prohibitions on certain sales practices, such as high pressure tactics, and on sales to Medicaid beneficiaries and sales of duplicate service benefit policies. Outlines general requirements for long-term care insurance policies. Imposes requirements on issuers of long-term care insurance policies with respect to: (1) policy mailing after approval; (2) information for policyholders and the Secretary and appropriate State officials on denied claims; and (3) medical assessments for elderly applicants with policies whose issue is not guaranteed. Sets forth civil penalties for violations involving unapproved or uncertified policies and prohibited sales practices. Requires reports by the Secretary to the Congress on functional ability assessment tools and solvency protections for issuers. Requires a study by the Secretary to develop a standard measure of value for long-term care insurance policies. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 to increase funding for long-term care insurance information, counseling, and assistance.
