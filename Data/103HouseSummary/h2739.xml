TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Airport and Airway Improvement Title II: Other Aviation Programs Title III: Research, Engineering, and Development Title IV: Extension of Airport and Airway Trust Fund Expenditure Authority Title V: Miscellaneous Provisions Title VI: Intrastate Transportation of Property Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 - Title I: Airport and Airway Improvement - Amends Federal transportation law to authorize appropriations for FY 1994 through 1996 for: (1) airport planning and airport development projects; and (2) airport noise compatibility planning programs. (Sec. 102) Decreases the FY 1994 and FY 1995 authorization of appropriations for air navigation facilities. Authorizes appropriations for such facilities for FY 1996. Sets forth limits on appropriations for FY 1994 through 1996 for certain costs incurred for: (1) maintaining air navigation facilities; and (2) joint financing of air navigation services. (Sec. 103) Authorizes appropriations for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through FY 1996. (Sec. 104) Declares congressional policy that the airport improvement program should be administered to encourage projects that employ innovative technology that will promote safety, capacity, and efficiency improvements in the construction of airports and in the air transportation system, including the development and use of innovative concrete and other materials in the construction of such facilities to minimize initial laydown costs, minimize time out of service, and maximize lifecycle durability. (Sec. 105) Includes as an &quot;airport development&quot; activity the acquisition or installation at or by a public-use airport of explosive detection devices and universal access systems. (Sec. 106) Authorizes a State to submit to the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) an application for an airport development and planning project grant that benefits one or more (currently, at least two) State airports. (Sec. 107) Authorizes the Secretary to approve the replacement or reconstruction of pavement at an airport only if the sponsor has provided assurances that such airport has implemented an airport pavement maintenance-management program. (Sec. 108) Repeals certain conditions relating to the approval of an aviation airport project application. (Sec. 109) Requires the Secretary prior to the approval of a project grant application for construction of a new hub airport that is expected to have 0.25 percent or more of the total annual enplanements in the United States to report to the Congress on its impact on: (1) fees incurred by air carriers for using the proposed airport; (2) air transportation that will be provided in the geographic region by it; and (3) the availability and cost of providing air transportation to rural areas in such region. (Sec. 110) Declares congressional policy that: (1) airport fees must be reasonable and may only be used for purposes not prohibited by this Act; (2) airports should be self-sustaining; and (3) in establishing new fees and generating new revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not create revenue surpluses that exceed amounts to be used for the airport system. (Sec. 111) Authorizes the Secretary to approve a project grant application for an airport development project only if he or she receives, among other things, assurances that the airport owner or operator will submit to the Secretary and make available to the public an annual report listing: (1) amounts paid by the airport to any other government unit and the purposes for which such payment was made; and (2) services and property provided to such units and the amount of compensation received for them. Requires the Secretary to prescribe a uniform format for reporting that is designed to enable the public to understand how airport funds are collected and spent. Directs the Secretary to provide specified congressional committees annual summaries of the above-mentioned airport financial report.
