Does not require employer contributions to the cost of coverage under such a plan. Provides for the exclusion of: (1) employers who have been employers for less than two years or who have no more than two eligible employees or no more than two eligible employees not covered under any group health plan; and (2) family members under specified circumstances. Specifies that a group health plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this Act solely because a period of service by an eligible employee of not more than 60 days is required for coverage. Specifies that the required coverage is standard coverage, except that in the case of a small employer that has not contributed during the previous plan year to the cost of coverage for any eligible employee under any group health plan, the required coverage for the plan year is coverage under a MedAccess standard, MedAccess catastrophic, and MedAccess medisave plan. Requires standard coverage to include at least one option, either a fee-for-service option and if available, a point-of-service option and a managed care option. Provides for a five-year transition for existing group health plans. Part 2: Portability and Nondiscrimination - Prohibits a group health plan from imposing (and an insurer from requiring an employer from imposing through a waiting period for coverage under a plan or similar requirement) a limitation or exclusion of benefits relating to treatment of a preexisting condition if: (1) the condition relates to a condition that was not diagnosed or treated within three months before the date of coverage under the plan; (2) the limitation or exclusion extends over more than six months after the date of coverage, applies to an individual who, as of the date of birth, was covered under the plan, or relates to pregnancy; or (3) an eligible individual has such coverage at the time the individual first became eligible. Specifies that, in the case of an individual who is eligible for coverage under a plan but for a waiting period imposed by the employer, the individual shall be treated as having been covered under the plan as of the earliest date of the beginning of the waiting period. Provides a one-time amnesty period for pre-existing condition exclusions. (Sec. 1012) Requires each group health plan to waive any period applicable to a preexisting condition for similar benefits with respect to an individual to the extent that the individual, prior to enrollment in such plan, was covered for the condition under any other health plan. (Sec. 1013) Prohibits: (1) a multiemployer plan and an exempted multiple employer health plan from canceling or denying renewal of coverage under such a plan for an employer other than for nonpayment of contributions, fraud or other misrepresentation, noncompliance with plan provisions, or because the plan is ceasing to provide any coverage in a geographic area; (2) an insurer from canceling a health insurance plan or denying renewal of coverage other than as prescribed above; and (3) an insurer who terminates the offering of health insurance plans in an area from offering such a plan to any employer in the area until five years after the date of the termination. Part 3: Standards for Managed Care Arrangements and Essential Community Providers - Sets forth requirements for group health plans and insurers that provide health care coverage through managed care arrangements. Requires such arrangements to assure that covered individuals have reasonably prompt access through the entity's provider network to the benefits package and to centers of excellence. (Sec. 1022) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to establish standards for utilization review programs and periodically review and update such standards to reflect changes in the delivery of health care services. Part 4: Enforcement; Effective Dates; Definitions - Makes provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 applicable with respect to enforcement of this Act (by the Department of Labor). Amends the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to impose a tax ($100 per day for each individual involved, subject to specified limitations) on the failure of an insurer to comply with the requirements under part 2, unless the Secretary determines that the State has in effect a regulatory enforcement mechanism that provides adequate sanctions. Subtitle B: Reform of Health Insurance - Part I: Marketplace for Small Business - Requires each insurer that makes available a health insurance plan to a small employer in a State to make available to each small employer in the State a MedAccess standard, MedAccess catastrophic, and MedAccess medisave plan, with exceptions for health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and if a State provides for guaranteed availability (rather than guaranteed issue). Requires each insurer that offers a MedAccess plan to a small employer in a State to accept: (1) every small employer in the State that applies for coverage; and (2) every eligible individual who applies for enrollment on a timely basis. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) special rules for HMOs; (2) timely enrollment requirements; and (3) enrollment of spouses and dependents. Makes such requirements inapplicable in a State that has provided (in accordance with specified standards) a mechanism under which each insurer offering a health insurance plan to a small employer in the State must participate in a program for assigning high-risk small employer groups (or individuals within such a group) among some or all such insurers, if the insurers comply. (Sec. 1102) Defines &quot;MedAccess coverage&quot; as a health insurance plan that: (1) is designed to provide standard coverage with substantial cost-sharing, only catastrophic coverage, or medisave coverage; (2) includes only essential and medically necessary services; (3) meets applicable requirements relating to guaranteed issue; and (4) meets specifies consumer protection standards. Defines &quot;MedAccess standard coverage,&quot; &quot;MedAccess catastrophic coverage,&quot; and &quot;MedAccess medisave coverage&quot; to mean a MedAccess plan that provides for at least standard coverage, for only catastrophic coverage, or medisave coverage, respectively. Requests the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to submit to the Secretary a set of rules which is sufficient for determining the actuarial value of coverage offered by a plan. Directs the Secretary to certify such set of rules for use under this subtitle if they meet such requirements or establish such a set of rules. Specifies that a health insurance plan is considered to provide: (1) standard coverage if the benefits are determined, in accordance with certified rules of actuarial equivalence, to have a value that is within five percentage points of an established target actuarial value for standard coverage; (2) catastrophic coverage if benefits are available under the plan for a year only to the extent that expenses for covered services in a year exceed a deductible amount that is consistent with a specified requirement for a catastrophic health plan under the Code, and are determined, in accordance with certified actuarial equivalence rules, to have a value that is within five percentage points of an established target actuarial value for catastrophic coverage; and (3) medisave coverage if such plan consists of a catastrophic health plan within the meaning of the Code and a medical savings account. Requests NAIC to submit to the Secretary target actuarial values for standard and catastrophic coverage. Permits NAIC to submit periodic revisions of, and permits the Secretary to revise, the set of rules of actuarial equivalence and target actuarial values where necessary to take into account changes in the relevant types of health benefits provisions, in deductible levels for catastrophic coverage, or in relevant demographic conditions. (Sec. 1103) Directs the Secretary to request NAIC to develop model regulations that specify standards with respect to requirements: (1) that insurers make available MedAccess plans; (2) of guaranteed availability of MedAccess plans to small employers; (3) relating to limits on premiums and certain consumer protections; and (4) relating to limitation of annual premium increases. Requires the Secretary to review such standards and, if NAIC fails to specify standards meeting such requirements, to promulgate standards. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the application of MedAccess standards and consumer protection standards by the States; and (2) the Federal role. (Sec. 1104) Sets forth provisions: (1) regarding limits on premium rate variations, including discounts for employer wellness programs; and (2) requiring an insurer, at the time of offering a health insurance plan to a small employer, to fully disclose rating practices for health insurance plans, including rating practices for different populations and benefit designs. (Sec. 1105) Requires the Secretary of Labor to monitor the prevalence and impact of adverse risk selection in the full insured plans made available to small employers resulting from the decision of small employers to self-insure. (Sec. 1106) Directs the Secretary to: (1) request NAIC to develop models for reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanisms for health insurance plans made available to small employers for whom an insurer is at risk of incurring high costs under the plan; and (2) review such models or specify models. Sets forth provisions regarding implementation of reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanisms by the States and the Federal role. Part 2: Marketplace for Individuals - Makes the provisions of Part 1 applicable to insurers offering health insurance coverage to individuals and their dependents. Part 3: Voluntary Health Purchasing Arrangements - Provides for the establishment of voluntary health purchasing arrangements. (Sec. 1124) Requires such arrangements to offer enrollment in health insurance coverage only to: (1) all eligible employees employed by small employers in a service area; and (2) all eligible individuals residing in such area. Part 4: Definitions and Miscellaneous Provisions - Provides definitions for purposes of this subtitle. (Sec. 1134) Requires the Secretary to make annual reports to the Congress on the implementation of this subtitle and the need for additional reforms to assure and expand coverage. (Sec. 1135) Authorizes the Director to conduct: (1) research on the impact of this subtitle on the availability of affordable health coverage for employees and dependents in the small employers group health care coverage market and other specified topics; and (2) demonstration projects relating to such topics. Requires the Director to develop: (1) methods for measuring the relative health risks of eligible individuals in terms of the expected costs of providing benefits under health insurance plans and, in particular, MedAccess plans; and (2) a model for equitably distributing health risks among insurers in the small employer health care coverage market. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle C: Preemption - Part 1: Scope of State Regulation - Makes inapplicable to a group health plan any State or local law requiring coverage of specific benefits, services, or categories of health care, or services of any class or type of provider of health care. (Sec. 1202) Makes inapplicable any State or local law prohibiting two or more employers from obtaining coverage under a multiple employer welfare arrangement under which all coverage: (1) consists of medical care described under specified provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA); and (2) is fully insured. (Sec. 1203) Preempts, for a five-year period, State law provisions which restrict: (1) reimbursement rates or selective contracting; (2) differential financing incentives; and (3) utilization review methods. Directs the Comptroller General to study benefits and cost effectiveness of use of managed care in health services delivery and to report to the Congress, including recommendations as to whether such preemption should be extended. Part 2: Multiple Employer Health Benefits Protections - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to provide a limited exemption from certain restrictions on ERISA preemption of State law for health plans maintained by multiple employers subject to certain Federal standards. Relieves such exempted multiple employer health plans of certain restrictions on preemption of State law, and treats them as employee welfare benefit plans. Sets forth exemption procedures, application and eligibility requirements, and additional notice, reporting, and actuarial requirements applicable to exempted multiple employer health plans. Requires multiple employer welfare arrangements providing certain medical care benefits to issue specified disclosures to participating employers. Requires each multiple employer welfare arrangement which is or has been an exempted multiple employer health plan, and under which coverage is not fully insured, to establish certain minimum reserves. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to permit alternative means of compliance. Sets forth corrective actions, including actions to avoid depletion of reserves and actions in connection with termination of arrangements. Provides for expirations, renewals, suspensions, and revocations of exemptions. Provides for review of actions of the Secretary, including denials of applications and suspensions or revocations of exemptions. Provides for alternative means of distribution of summary plan descriptions. (Sec. 1212) Revises provisions relating to scope of preemption rules, treatment of single employer arrangements, and treatment of certain collectively bargained arrangements.

(Sec. 1217) Sets forth solvency requirements for certain self- insured group health plans. (Sec. 1218) Sets forth filing requirements for multiple employer welfare arrangements providing health benefits.

(Sec. 1220) Sets forth transitional rules. Part 3: Encouragement of Multiple Employer Arrangements Providing Basic Health Benefits - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate the commonality of interest or geographic location requirement for tax-exempt trust status in the case of determining whether any multiple employer health plan or insured multiple employer health plan is a voluntary employees' beneficiary association meeting certain requirements, if: (1) such plan provides at least standard coverage consistent with specified provisions of this Act (the Affordable Health Care Now Act of 1994); and (2) in the case of such an insured plan, it meets specified ERISA requirements not preempted by this Act. (Sec. 1222) Amends ERISA to direct the Secretary of Labor to prescribe an alternative method for the filing of a single annual report with respect to all employers participating under a multiple employer welfare arrangement under which all coverage consists of medical care and is fully insured.
