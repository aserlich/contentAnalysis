	<summary>
	2/22/1994--Passed House amended. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) it is in the national interest for the United States to remain actively engaged in the South Pacific region as a means of supporting important U.S. commercial and strategic interests and to encourage the consolidation of democratic values; and (2) notwithstanding current fiscal constraints, the executive branch, particularly the Department of State, should work actively with the Congress to continue foreign assistance provided to the region and to encourage the active participation in the region of other international donors. Declares that the United States: (1) should encourage economic, trade, and investment relationships with the countries of the South Pacific; (2) should seek to maintain its diplomatic presence in the South Pacific region; (3) has interests in preserving the natural resources and biodiversity of the region and is uniquely positioned to promote sustainable development; (4) should cooperate closely with regional governments to strengthen sustainable management principles and practices as they apply to the region's fisheries resources; (5) should avail itself of the opportunity for contact with leaders of all South Pacific countries through regular ministerial/cabinet level meetings; and (6) should take an active interest in the proposed Joint Declaration of Cooperation between the United States and certain Pacific Island governments.
