Mike Mansfield Fellowship Act - Establishes the Mike Mansfield Fellowship Program. Requires the Director of the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) to make grants to the Mansfield Center for Pacific Affairs to award two-year fellowships to eligible Federal employees. Requires Mansfield Fellows to: (1) study the Japanese language and political economy; and (2) serve in an agency of the Government of Japan, or, subject to Center approval, a nongovernmental Japanese institution associated with their interests. Requires the Center to comply with specified program requirements in order to be eligible for such grants. Authorizes the Director to enter into an arrangement with the Government of Japan to place Fellows. Authorizes the Foreign Service Institute to assist in carrying out Japanese language training by the Center. Authorizes appropriations. Requires that the Federal employees eligible for such fellowships have: (1) at least two years' experience in any branch of the U.S. Government; and (2) a strong career interest in U.S.-Japan relations and a commitment to further Federal service. Requires at least ten fellowships to be awarded annually. Prohibits Mansfield Fellows from engaging in any intelligence-related activity on behalf of the U.S. Government.
