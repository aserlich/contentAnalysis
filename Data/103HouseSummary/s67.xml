	1/21/1993--Introduced.
General Aviation Accident Liability Standards Act of 1993 - Declares that this Act supersedes any State law regarding liability for general aviation accidents. Establishes guidelines for uniform standards of liability of general aviation manufacturers for general aviation accidents, including the principle of comparative responsibility. Establishes, with specified exceptions, a limitation of actions period of 20 years from delivery of aircraft or harm-causing part to the purchaser for general aviation civil liability brought against a general aviation manufacturer. Permits the award of punitive damages if a claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the harm suffered was the direct result of conduct manifesting conscious, flagrant indifference to safety. Establishes a two-year limitation of actions period for actions arising out of a general aviation accident. Confers original jurisdiction upon the Federal district courts, concurrently with State courts, for all civil actions that exceed $50,000 for harm arising out of a general aviation accident. Provides procedures for removal from State to Federal district courts of such actions.
