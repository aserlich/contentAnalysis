	7/1/1993--Introduced.
Collective Security Participation Resolution - Urges the President to initiate discussions among members of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, the General Assembly, and the Military Staff Committee leading to negotiations, under Article 43 of the UN Charter, of special agreements with equitable terms under which designated forces from various countries, including the United States, would be available to the Security Council. Affirms support for the commitment made to the General Assembly by President Bush to make bases and facilities available to the Security Council for multinational training of forces under the UN. Urges the President to consult with specified congressional committees in the course of negotiating an Article 43 agreement. Expresses congressional intent to give prompt consideration to any such agreement. Reaffirms Congress's commitment to the principle that congressional approval of an Article 43 agreement shall have the effect of providing the President with full authority to direct that the U.S. armed forces designated in such agreement be employed as may be necessary to support Security Council decisions.
