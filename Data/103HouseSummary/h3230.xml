	10/6/1993--Introduced.
Minority Health Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1993 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Office of Minority Health to establish a center to carry out programs to improve access to health care services for individuals lacking proficiency in speaking English. Establishes an Office of Minority Health in specified agencies of the Public Health Service. Provides for equitable allocation of appropriations for certain health programs. Revises the factors to be considered in designating medically underserved populations and health professional shortage areas to include the percentage of members of racial or ethnic minority groups and the extent of cultural and language barriers. Authorizes appropriations for grants to migrant health centers and community health centers for programs to reduce the extent to which a lack of proficiency in English or other cultural factors constitutes a significant barrier to obtaining health services. Provides funding for the Centers of Excellence, activities of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, and certain activities of the National Center for Health Statistics. Requires such entities to spend a portion of such funding on ethnic and racial minorities. Authorizes appropriations for a demonstration project relating to Hispanics, African Americans, and other populations that are at significant risk of contracting diabetes mellitus.
