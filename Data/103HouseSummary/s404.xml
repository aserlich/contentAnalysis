Federal Employee Fairness Act of 1993 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to permit a Federal employee (defined to include employees and applicants and to include appointees and applicants under provisions relating to veterans' health care) filing a discrimination complaint to file it with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Requires that any such complaint filed with an agency other than the EEOC be transmitted to the EEOC. Prohibits discharging or discriminating in any way against a Federal employee filing a complaint. Sets forth procedures for filing and processing such complaints. Permits a Federal employee to file a complaint up to 180 days following an alleged discrimination. Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to permit the filing of a complaint with the EEOC in accordance with the amendments made to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by this Act. Amends title 5 of the U.S. Code, concerning Government organization and employees, to permit an employee, under a negotiated grievance procedure, to raise matters covered under provisions of title 5 dealing with actions involving discrimination.
