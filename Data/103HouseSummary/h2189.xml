	5/19/1993--Introduced.
Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Relief Act of 1993 - Exempts municipal solid waste landfills existing as of October 8, 1993, which meet criteria under the Solid Waste Disposal Act applicable as of January 1, 1993, from any revised criteria (established for facilities which may receive hazardous wastes) for a six-month period. Provides for an additional 12-month extension of such exemption (but not beyond April 1, 1995) if the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines that a State has made a good faith effort to comply with such Act. Bars exemption extensions for landfills: (1) at which total waste receipts exceed 100 tons daily on average over the term of the extension; (2) which accept wastes other than municipal solid waste; and (3) which have expanded laterally or which are not in compliance with liner standards.
