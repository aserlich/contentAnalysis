TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Trade Remedy Actions Title II: Extension and Modification of Fair Trade in Auto Parts Act Fair Trade in Motor Vehicle Parts Act of 1993 - Title I: Trade Remedy Actions - Declares that any act, policy, or practice of a deficit foreign country that adversely affects the access to its market of U.S. motor vehicle parts (including, but not limited to, any act, policy, or practice utilized in such country's motor vehicle distribution system) shall, for purposes of &quot;301&quot; action under the Trade Act of 1974, be considered as an act, policy, or practice that is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce. Directs the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to determine what action to take under the Act to eliminate such act, policy, or practice. Requires an agenda for negotiations with countries the USTR has taken action against to include: (1) a certain percentage of guaranteed sales in the deficit foreign country's market of U.S. motor vehicle parts; (2) the elimination or modification of the aspects of such country's motor vehicle distribution system that act as a barrier to U.S. motor vehicle parts; and (3) the exchange between such country and the United States of information concerning bilateral trade in such parts. Requires the USTR to make certain estimates with respect to the current percentage of such country's market for motor vehicle parts that is accounted for by U.S. motor vehicle parts. Requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to commence an antidumping duty investigation to determine if imports of motor vehicle parts from a deficit foreign country, or sales (or the likelihood of sales) of such imports, constitute grounds for the imposition of antidumping duties. Title II: Extension and Modification of Fair Trade in Auto Parts Act - Amends the Fair Trade in Auto Parts Act of 1988 to extend such Act through December 31, 1998. Directs the Secretary, among other things, to coordinate: (1) U.S. policy regarding auto parts and the market for auto parts by the Japanese; and (2) the sharing of data and market information among U.S. agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce, and the Office of the USTR.
