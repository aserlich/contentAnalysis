	<summary>
	6/27/1994--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and within 180 days after the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency publishes a final maximum contaminant level (MCL) for drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act, to promulgate a regulation establishing a quality level for the contaminant in bottled water or make a finding that a regulation is not necessary to protect the public health because the contaminant is contained in public water systems. Provides that such regulation: (1) shall require that the quality level for the contaminant in bottled water be as stringent as the MCL published by the Administrator; and (2) may require that the quality level be more stringent if necessary to provide public health protection. Makes the MCL the bottled water quality level standard if the Secretary fails to promulgate the regulation as required.
