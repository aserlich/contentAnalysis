(Sec. 1003) Revises certain qualifying circumstances for the award of contracts between $100,000 and $1 million under noncompetitive procedures. (Sec. 1004) Repeals expiring authority for the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to enter into master agreements and issue task orders. Creates new authority for the head of a subject agency to: (1) enter into task order contracts for advisory and assistance services; and (2) appoint a task order ombudsman for reviewing complaints involving multiple contracts. (Sec. 1005) Provides for procurement of expert services for court or administrative proceedings. (Sec. 1012) Relocates provisions concerning purchase option evaluation. (Sec. 1013) Requires notice to all offerors not awarded a contract as soon as practicable after the contract is awarded.

(Sec. 1021) Eliminates: (1) certain restrictions on cost and incentive contracts; and (2) annual reports by DOD advocates for competition. Part II: Civilian Agency Acquisitions - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (FPASA), the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (OFPPA), and other specified Federal law to make changes similar to those above with respect to civilian agencies, including adding provisions to FPASA for: (1) task order contracts for advisory and assistance services; (2) continued occupancy of leased space; (3) issuance of solicitations for contracts to be awarded using sealed bid procedures; (4) multiyear contracts for the acquisition of property and services; and (5) contracts for procurement of severable services for periods crossing fiscal years.

Subtitle B: Truth in Negotiations - Part I: Armed Services Acquisitions - Amends Federal law (the Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA)) to revise cost or pricing data requirements to: (1) repeal the sunset date for the requirement that offerors submit cost or pricing data for prime contracts (to be entered into without sealed bid procedures) above the $500,000 threshold (thus making it permanent); (2) provide for periodic adjustments in such threshold for inflation; and (3) make changes in exceptions to data submission requirements. (Sec. 1203) Requires a written determination to be made by the head of the subject agency before requiring the submission of cost or pricing data in cases where the acquisition is below the TINA threshold or one of the TINA exceptions applies. (Sec. 1204) Creates a new exception to the submission requirement for commercial item cost or pricing data that applies where competition is not practicable and the contracting officer determines that there is adequate data to determine price reasonableness. (Sec. 1206) Provides for: (1) regulations concerning the types of information that must be submitted for the contracting officer to consider in determining price reasonableness when cost or pricing data are not required because the acquisition is not expected to exceed the $500,000 threshold; and (2) consistent time references with respect to when an agreement on the price of a prime contract is effective for purposes related to contract price reductions because of defective data.
