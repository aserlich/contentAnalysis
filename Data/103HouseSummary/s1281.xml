(Sec. 102) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1994 and 1995 for: (1) international organizations, programs, and conferences; (2) international commissions; (3) offsetting adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (4) migration and refugee assistance; (5) U.S. bilateral science and technology agreements; and (6) the Asia Foundation. Reduces funds for international organizations by a specified amount in such fiscal years unless the President has certified to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate that no United Nations agency or affiliated agency grants official status or recognition to any organization which promotes, condones, or seeks the legalization of pedophilia or which includes as a member any such organization. Part B: Authorities and Activities - Establishes limits on the number of Foreign Service personnel in the Department of State and the U.S. Information Agency (USIA). (Sec. 114) Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize the Secretary of State to procure the services of experts for use in prosecuting a proceeding before an international tribunal or a claim by or against a foreign entity. Establishes an International Litigation Fund for meeting expenses related to such proceedings. (Sec. 115) Prohibits the Department of State from entering into any contract that expends funds for an amount in excess of the small purchase threshold with: (1) any foreign person who complies with the Arab League boycott of Israel; or (2) any foreign or U.S. person who discriminates in the award of subcontracts on the basis of religion. Provides for waivers of such prohibition in the national interest. (Sec. 118) Directs the Secretary to implement an upgrade of all overseas visa lookout operations to computerized systems with automated multiple-name search capabilities. Establishes procedures for the processing of visas for admission into the United States and considers failure to follow such procedures as a negative factor in annual performance evaluations of consular officers.
