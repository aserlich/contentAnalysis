	8/5/1993--Introduced.
Federal Coal Equity Act of 1993 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to consider: (1) the economic impact that mining under a proposed lease might have on competition in the coal industry; and (2) whether there is sufficient market demand for such additional coal. Precludes the Secretary from issuing such lease if the Secretary determines that production of coal would lead to the displacement of coal produced from existing mining operations serving the existing markets.
