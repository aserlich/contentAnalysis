Excludes video bingo from the definition of class II gaming. Includes video bingo, and any other forms of electronic video games or devices, as well as slot machines, within the definition of class III gaming. Shifts the burden of proof from a State to an Indian tribe in a compact negotiation-related action initiated by a tribe. Increases the membership of the National Indian Gaming Commission.
