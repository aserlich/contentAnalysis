Disparate Treatment Employment Discrimination Amendment of 1993 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide that an unlawful employment practice based on disparate treatment is established if the complaining party proves by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case that the respondent engaged in unlawful disparate treatment based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and either: (1) the respondent fails to rebut such case; or (2) the respondent produces evidence of one or more nondiscriminatory reasons for the conduct alleged to be unlawful and the complaining party demonstrates that each of such reasons is not true, but a pretext for discrimination that is the unlawful disparate practice.
