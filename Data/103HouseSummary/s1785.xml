	<summary>
	11/24/1993--Introduced.
Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to: (1) shorten to 48 months the period that a five-day waiting period and background check are to be imposed pending establishment of a national instant criminal background check system (system) for handgun transfers; and (2) provide that system check requirements shall not apply until notification by the Attorney General to licensees that the system is operational and capable of supplying information immediately. Makes the latter provision inapplicable to a firearm transfer between a licensee and another person who has presented a firearm permit meeting certain conditions. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish the system within 24 (currently, 60) months after the enactment of such Act; and (2) notify each licensee in, and the chief law enforcement officer of, a State at any time of a determination that the State is in compliance with the timetable set for that State. Authorizes a prospective transferee to submit to the Attorney General information to correct, clarify, or supplement records of the system with respect to the prospective transferee. Requires the Attorney General to immediately consider the information, to investigate further, and to correct erroneous information and give notice of the error to any Federal department or agency or any State that was the source of such records. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include among State application requirements for drug control and system improvement grants a certification that the State has established a plan under which the State will provide the Department of Justice with notification of adjudications of persons as mental defectives and of commitments to mental institutions.
