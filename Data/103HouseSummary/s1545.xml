Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1993 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1994 through 1996 for environmental research, development, and demonstration activities and program management support of the Office of Research and Development of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Prohibits the EPA Administrator from closing any field station, regional office, laboratory, or other research center, permitting any reduction-in-force, or finalizing any closing or reduction unless specified congressional committees are provided with pertinent information prior to the notice of closing or reduction. Directs the Administrator to establish separately identified ecological, health, and risk reduction research programs for purposes of assessing and mitigating serious environmental risks. Requires the Administrator to carry out an Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research to: (1) enhance the competitiveness within the peer-review system of investigators from academic institutions in eligible States; and (2) increase the probability of long-term growth of competitive funding to such investigators. Provides for assistance to eligible States under certain conditions and earmarks funding for such assistance. Directs the Administrator to establish a National Human Exposure Assessment Survey to monitor and assess the extent and characteristics of human exposure to harmful chemical substances. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) conduct research on the nature and impacts of international environmental problems and ways to respond to such problems; and (2) provide assistance to foreign countries and international bodies to improve the quality of the environment. Directs the Administrator to conduct specified pesticide monitoring and research. National Arid Climate Ground Water Research Center Act - Requires the Administrator to establish the National Arid Climate Ground Water Research Center in the State of Nevada. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Administrator to establish an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program and a Modernization Program to acquire and maintain buildings, supplies, and equipment needed to conduct high quality research. Directs the Science Advisory Board to report annually to the Congress and the Administrator on the views of the Board concerning proposed research programs described in the President's annual budget. Requires the Administrator to: (1) carry out a program of environmental technology transfer and exchange of scientific and technical information; (2) establish a separately identified research program to assess risks to public health and ecosystems from environmental contamination; (3) establish a lead research program; and (4) carry out a research program to reduce the scientific uncertainties with respect to the assessment of certain environmental risks. Authorizes appropriations for the lead research program. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on opportunities for the technology transfer of defense-related research for environmental applications. Requires the Administrator to conduct research on disinfection and disinfection byproducts as part of the negotiated rulemaking procedures for national primary drinking water regulations for Phase VIA contaminants. Authorizes appropriations. Expresses the sense of the Congress that any recipient of a grant under this Act should, when they are available and cost-effective, purchase equipment and products manufactured in the United States.
