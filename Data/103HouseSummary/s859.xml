	<summary>
	7/12/1994--Passed House amended. Provides that the restrictions on conveyances and use of specified lands patented to Kaysville, Utah, shall not apply to those lands upon which communications facilities were located as of January 1, 1993. Allows reasonable use of an access route in existence on June 1, 1994, across National Forest lands for repair, maintenance, or improvement of such facilities but specifies that the Secretary of Agriculture shall not be required to improve the condition of such access route or to provide additional access routes for such purposes. Permits: (1) the use of such lands for recreational purposes consistent with the protection of the city's watershed and water supply system and with the management objectives for adjacent National Forest System lands; and (2) construction of structures or other improvements associated with such recreational activities only to the extent that the Secretary determines that such construction would be consistent with protection of the watershed and would not adversely affect the resources and values of such lands.
