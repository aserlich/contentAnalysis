Federal Stalking Prevention Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal criminal code to set penalties for stalking (i.e., conduct that involves an express or implied threat to kill or to inflict bodily injury that is made with the intent to place a person in fear and in a manner or context that causes that person reasonably to fear bodily injury or death). Directs the United States Sentencing Commission, in establishing sentencing guidelines for stalking, to provide a longer prison sentence for second or subsequent offenses while a protection order was in effect governing the defendant's behavior toward the victim.
