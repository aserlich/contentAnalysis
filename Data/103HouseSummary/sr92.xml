	<summary>
	4/2/1993--Introduced.
Condemns North Korea for its stated intention to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States and its international partners should take measured steps to compel North Korea to remain a party to the Treaty and to allow unconditional special inspections of apparent nuclear waste sites and other areas suspected of harboring a nuclear weapons-building program.
