	<summary>
	11/10/1993--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the Federal financial institution regulatory agencies, in any effort to reform regulations implementing the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the Act), should consider giving financial institutions credit for providing credit and investments which may assist in fighting the causes of violence and in preventing crime in their communities, including loans to police officers and firefighters who establish their residences in high crime neighborhoods, loans for community recreation facilities in such neighborhoods, and loans for job creating activities for youths or adults who might otherwise become involved in crime; (2) regulations promulgated or amended under the Act should give positive consideration to investments made by financial institutions in other financial intermediaries which have the effect of stabilizing neighborhoods and fighting the causes of violence and preventing crime in those neighborhoods; (3) loans and investments extended by a financial institution for the purpose of fighting the causes of violence and preventing crime outside of its normal lending area or geographic community should be considered legitimate community reinvestment activities; and (4) reformed regulations under the Act should not define a financial institution's &quot;local community&quot; so narrowly that loans and investments provided to fight the causes of violence and help prevent crime will not be positively considered under the Act simply because they are extended outside the area normally delineated by the institution as its &quot;local community.&quot;
