	<summary>
	8/4/1993--Introduced.
Instructs the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to investigate allegations that the House Post Office provided cash to any Member in exchange for official vouchers, stamps purchased with official vouchers, campaign account checks, or in any other way inconsistent with the Rules of the House. Requires the Committee to: (1) determine which Members are alleged by the former Postmaster to have engaged in improper conduct in connection with the House Post Office and whether these Members are the subjects of any current investigation by the Department of Justice; and (2) defer further inquiry into a Member's conduct if that be the case, pending conclusion of the investigation. Requires the Committee to report to the House on its investigations and makes such report available to the public.
