Rio Grande Designation Act of 1993 - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a segment of the Rio Grande, New Mexico, as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Requires a study of such River to be completed within three years after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish the Rio Grande Citizens Oversight Review Board to advise the Secretary with respect to: (1) a management plan for the River segment designated for the System; and (2) the preparation of the required study. Withdraws the Orilla Verde Recreation Area, New Mexico, from U.S. public land, mining, mineral, and geothermal leasing laws. Authorizes the Secretary to contract with the Smithsonian Institution for the completion of the prehistoric trackways study in New Mexico as required under current law.
