(Sec. 110) Authorizes States to apply for airport development projects or airport planning for similar projects benefitting one or more (currently, two or more) airports if specified conditions are met. (Sec. 111) Declares as an &quot;allowable cost,&quot; reimbursable by the Federal Government, airport development and planning project costs that are incurred: (1) not more than two years before the grant agreement for such project is executed; (2) between September 30, 1993, and September 30, 1996; and (3) in accordance with an approved airport layout plan.

(Sec. 113) Authorizes the Secretary to issue letters of intent and use funds for planning, approving, and administering grants under the Airport Improvement Program.

(Sec. 115) Requires the Secretary, before approval of a project grant application for construction of a new hub airport that is expected to have .25 percent or more of the total annual U.S. enplanements, to report to the Congress an analysis of the impact of such proposed new airport on: (1) fees charged to air carriers and other costs incurred by air carriers for using the airport; (2) air transportation that will be provided in the airport's geographic region; and (3) the availability and cost of providing air transportation to rural areas in the geographic region. (Sec. 116) Authorizes the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator to contract for the collection of airport safety data using sole source or limited source authority.

Requires a planning agency, before the Secretary's approval of a grant to it for integrated airport system planning, to certify: (1) that the sponsor of any airport enplaning .25 percent or more of the total number of passengers enplaned annually at all commercial service airports is considered to be an operator of a major mode of transportation; and (2) that such sponsor is a member, or will be appointed a member, of such planning agency.

(Sec. 203) Permits, under specified conditions, nighttime takeoffs and landings at Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, Colorado, for pilots operating under instrument flight rules or visual flight rules under the CFR. Declares that the owner or operator of such airport shall be considered in compliance with specified aviation safety requirements and not unjustly discriminatory to air carriers if they notify the FAA Administrator that they commit to: (1) modify their existing regulation to expand access to general aviation operations under the above-mentioned conditions for night operations at such airport; and (2) permanently not enforce regulations eliminating the so-called &quot;ski season exception&quot; to its nighttime curfew. Directs the FAA Administrator to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking on mountain flying. (Sec. 204) Requires the Secretary's current examination of slot regulations at high density airports to include consideration of the impact: (1) of the current slot allocation process upon the ability of air carriers to provide essential air service in accordance with a specified section of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958; (2) of the process upon the ability of new entrant air carriers to obtain slots in time periods that enable them to provide service; (3) of the process on the ability of foreign air carriers to obtain slots; and (4) of aircraft noise on affected communities. Requires the examination also to consider: (1) the fairness of the process to air carriers and the extent to which they are provided equivalent rights of access to airports in countries of which foreign air carriers holding slots are citizens; and (2) the impact, on the ability of air carriers to provide domestic and international service, of the withdrawal of slots from air carriers in order to provide slots for foreign air carriers.

(Sec. 210) Changes from December 31 to March 31 the deadline for the Secretary's annual report to the Congress on transportation security. (Sec. 211) Prohibits any State or interstate agency or political agency of two or more States from enacting a law relating to rates, routes, or services of any intermodal all-cargo air carrier when it is transporting property, pieces, parcels, or packages between States or within a State by aircraft or motor vehicle (whether or not such property has had or will have a prior or subsequent air movement). Title III: Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 Amendments - Amends the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 to repeal the requirement for an annual report on the status of the development of collision avoidance systems in the national air traffic control system.
