No Net Loss of Private Lands Act - Authorizes the United States to acquire an interest in 100 or more acres of land within a State only if, before any such acquisition, the United States disposes of the surface estate to land in that State in accordance with the following requirements. Specifies that the disposition of the surface estate in land by the United States qualifies for the purpose of such provision if: (1) the value of such estate is approximately equal to the value of the interest in the land to be acquired, as determined by the Secretary of the department concerned; and (2) such Secretary certifies that the United States has disposed of land for the purpose of this section. Subjects acquisition of land within a State to this Act if 25 percent or more of the land within the State is federally-owned. Excludes specified lands and properties from this Act. Authorizes the head of any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States to waive such land acquisition requirements during a declaration of war or national emergency.
