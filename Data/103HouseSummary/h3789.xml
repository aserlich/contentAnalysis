	2/3/1994--Introduced.
Budget Accountability Act of 1994 - Provides for the termination of Federal programs that are not reauthorized by the Congress. Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit the consideration of legislation that does not contain an authorization period for the use of appropriated amounts. Prohibits the imposition of any tax unless a later date for such tax to terminate is specified by law. Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit the consideration of such legislation. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the House rule concerning the reporting requirements in general appropriations bills should be vigorously applied; (2) laws that affect the Federal revenue should be periodically reviewed by the appropriate congressional committees to determine, based on the health of the economy, whether such laws should continue in effect; and (3) reducing the debt of the Federal Government is critical to the long-term health of the economy.
