	<summary>
	6/9/1993--Introduced.
Amends Federal law to require both the President and the Congress to draft a budget based on estimates of current fiscal year spending, proposing increases or decreases based on this level (rather than on an estimated baseline). Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the Congressional Budget Office to use such a current fiscal year baseline in its report to the congressional budget committees, projecting growth for entitlement and discretionary spending based on current fiscal year spending. Terminates spending authority, effective October 1, 1993, for unearned entitlements and high-cost discretionary spending programs unless such spending authority is reauthorized. Terminates spending authority, effective October 1, 1994, for each discretionary spending program (not including high-cost discretionary spending programs) unless such spending authority is reauthorized. Provides for terminating such spending authorities after the year 2000 unless appropriately reauthorized.
