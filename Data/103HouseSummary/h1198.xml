Trade Agreements Compliance Act of 1993 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize certain economically affected persons to request the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to review whether a foreign country is in material compliance with the terms of a bilateral trade agreement to which the United States is a party. Prescribes guidelines for such a review. Provides that nothing in this Act may be construed as requiring actions that are inconsistent with U.S. international obligations, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
