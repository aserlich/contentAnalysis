Government Procurement Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and Federal armed forces provisions to direct Federal agency heads, in evaluating an offeror's price contained in any bid or proposal for any procurement in excess of $100,000, to treat as containing the lowest price the bid or proposal which will yield the lowest net cost to the Government. Directs such Federal officials, in determining the net costs to the Government, to deduct from the offeror's price any receipts which are likely to accrue to the Government through the offeror's performance of the procurement contract.
