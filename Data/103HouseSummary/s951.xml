(Sec. 101) Limits Senate: (1) personal expenditures to $25,000 during an election cycle; (2) primary election expenditures to the lesser of 67 percent of the general election limit or $2.5 million; (3) runoff election expenditures to 20 percent of the general election limit; and (4) general election expenditures to the lesser of $4.5 million or the greater of $775,000, or $325,000 plus 30 cents times the voting age population up to 4 million and 25 cents times the voting age population over 4 million. Exempts from the election expenditure limits: (1) qualified legal and accounting expenditures from a legal and accounting compliance fund meeting certain requirements; (2) certain expenditures made from independent or excess receipts. Permits a candidate to accept excess contributions or make excess expenditures if a non-eligible opponent's contributions or expenditures exceed 200 percent of applicable limits. Limits multicandidate political committee (PAC) contributions to a candidate to ten percent of the primary and runoff election limits. Entitles eligible candidates to free broadcast media rates, mailing rates, and in certain circumstances, payments compensating for independent expenditures, excess expenditures, and public financing amounts. Requires the Federal Election Commission (Commission) to certify that a candidate meets the eligibility requirements. Requires the Commission to examine and audit, for FECA compliance, the campaign accounts of ten percent of all Senate candidates, and the campaign accounts of all opponents of such candidates as well. Requires candidates to refund to the Commission any excess payments, expenditures, or voter communication vouchers. Sets forth related civil and criminal penalties. Provides for judicial review of Commission actions and requires Commission reports to the Senate. Establishes in the Treasury the Senate Election Campaign Fund. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 102) Prohibits PAC activities in Federal elections. (Sec. 103) Sets forth candidate reporting requirements.

(Sec. 135) Amends Federal law to prohibit a Senator who is a candidate for election to any public office from making a mass mailing under the frank during the calendar year of any primary or general election for such office. Title II: Independent Expenditures - Amends FECA to define &quot;independent expenditure&quot; as an expenditure for an advertisement or other communication that: (1) contains express advocacy; and (2) is made without the participation or cooperation of a candidate or a candidate's representative. Excludes from the meaning of &quot;independent expenditure&quot; any expenditure by: (1) a political committee of a political party; (2) persons who communicate or receive information about activities that have a purpose of influencing a candidate's election; and (3) persons with other specified relationships with a candidate or candidate's agents in the same election cycle. Defines &quot;express advocacy&quot; as any communication that when taken as a whole: (1) expresses support for or opposition to a specific candidate, a specific group of candidates, or candidates of a particular political party; or (2) suggests taking action with respect to an election, such as voting for or against, contributing to, or participating in campaign activity. Title III: Expenditures - Subtitle A: Personal Loans; Credit - Amends FECA to prohibit the use of contributions after the date of a general election to repay loans to a candidate (or authorized committee) by the candidate himself or herself or by members of the candidate's family.

Subjects to certain limitations, prohibitions and reporting requirements any amount (&quot;soft money&quot;) solicited, received, or expended directly or indirectly by a national, State, district, or local committee of a political party (including any subordinate committee) with respect to an activity (such as voter registration and get-out-the vote activities, among others) which, in whole or in part, is in connection with an election to Federal office. Prohibits a national political party committee from soliciting or accepting contributions not subject to FECA limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements. Cites conditions under which any amount received by the national, State, district, or local committee of a political party (including any subordinate committee) from a State or local candidate committee shall be treated as meeting the soft money requirements of this title.

(Sec. 404) Prohibits a candidate for Federal office from accepting, with respect to any election, any contribution from a State or local political party committee (or subordinate committee) if such contribution, when added to the total of contributions previously accepted from all such committees of that political party, exceeds the relevant contribution limitation. (Sec. 405) Excludes from the meaning of &quot;contribution&quot; any campaign expense voluntarily paid for by a campaign worker as an advance to the campaign, provided the amount does not exceed $500 and is reimbursed by the committee within ten days.
