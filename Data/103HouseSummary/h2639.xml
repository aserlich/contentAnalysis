	<summary>
	11/8/1993--Passed House amended. Telecommunications Infrastructure and Facilities Assistance Act of 1993 - Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (NTIAO Act) to provide for grants to eligible applicants for the construction of public broadcasting facilities. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to give special consideration to applications which would increase participation by minorities, women, and populations traditionally underserved in the ownership and operation of public broadcasting entities. Requires a substantial amount of appropriated funds to be available for the expansion and development of noncommercial radio broadcast station facilities. Provides for Federal recovery of funds from a grant recipient if, within five years of any construction project, the applicant or owner of the facility ceases to be an eligible applicant or the facilities cease to be used primarily for public broadcasting purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to eligible applicants to assist the development of a national telecommunications and information infrastructure to: (1) enhance the delivery to the public of social services; and (2) support the formation of a nationwide, multimedia, interactive infrastructure of varied information technologies. Requires the Secretary to give special consideration to applications that will increase participation by populations traditionally underserved in the ownership and operation of, and access to, telecommunications and information infrastructure and that will avoid unnecessary duplication of existing facilities and services. Provides for Federal recovery of funds under the same conditions applicable to recovery of grant monies for public broadcasting construction. Directs the Secretary to collect and disseminate information on distance learning and telemedicine projects. Incorporates provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 which provide for a National Endowment for Children's Educational Television into the NTIAO Act and extends the authorization of appropriations for the Endowment. Repeals provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 that provide assistance for construction of public telecommunications facilities and telecommunications demonstration projects similar to those authorized under this Act. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NITA) through FY 1996. Requires NITA to study and report on the feasibility of establishing networks using modern telecommunications technologies to provide educational and other training to ensure growth and opportunities in Africa. Authorizes appropriations.
