	<summary>
	5/6/1993--Introduced.
Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from designing, constructing, or acquiring interests in land for any unit of a reclamation project for which funds have not been previously appropriated and obligated. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend design and construction activities of a project the continuance of which would result in a net loss to the United States. Directs the Secretary to: (1) transfer the operation, maintenance, and replacement of reclamation projects to the water districts which benefit from them; (2) contract for the management of any reclamation project not so transferred; and (3) study and report to the Congress on the true value of water provided from water reclamation projects.
