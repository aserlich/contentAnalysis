	1/21/1993--Introduced.
Spring Mountains National Recreation Area Act - Establishes the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area in Nevada. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a general management plan for the Area as an amendment to the Toiyabe National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan. Requires inclusion in the plan any Bureau of Land Management recommendations as to the suitability of specified wilderness study areas for preservation as wilderness. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, to manage the lands and waters within the wilderness study areas to maintain their potential for inclusion within the National Wilderness Preservation System, pending submission of such recommendation and until otherwise directed by an Act of the Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire such lands, or lesser interests in lands, as necessary to carry out this Act. Withdraws all Federal lands within the Area and lands, waters, and interests in such acquired by the United States after the enactment of this Act from public land and mining laws (including mineral and geothermal leasing), with exceptions. Directs the Secretary to coordinate the management of the Area with that of all proximate lands in a manner that best meets the present and future needs of the people of the United States. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with nonprofit entities and other Federal, State, and local agencies to provide for the management and interpretation of natural and cultural resources in southern Nevada. Authorizes appropriations.
