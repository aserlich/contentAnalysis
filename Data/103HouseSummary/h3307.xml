	10/19/1993--Introduced.
Multiethnic Placement Act of 1993 - Prohibits any entity that receives Federal assistance from giving greater weight to any difference between the race, color, or national origin of a child and that of the prospective parent than to any other factor when weighing factors used in determining the best interests of the child in placing a child for foster care or adoption (except with respect to such a placement under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978) when a prospective parent of the same race, color, or national origin as the child is not available. Authorizes a private right of action in the appropriate U.S. district court for any individual aggrieved by a violation of the prohibition above involving multiethnic placements. Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to deny Federal foster care and adoption assistance payments to State programs violating such prohibition.
