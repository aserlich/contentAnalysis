TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Nonpoint Source Management Programs Title II: Nonpoint Source Prevention on Federal Lands Title III: Water Quality Criteria; Standards; Antidegradation; New Sources Title IV: Citizen Watershed Monitoring Program Nonpoint Source Water Pollution Prevention Act of 1993 - Title I: Nonpoint Source Management Programs - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require State Governors to revise nonpoint source management programs for purposes of achieving full restoration and protection of target watersheds. Directs State Governors to: (1) identify and prioritize target watersheds into five groups based on the severity of nonpoint source pollution problems; and (2) notify landowners and operators who conduct nonpoint source activities in first priority group watersheds that they will be required to implement site-level programs. Establishes requirements for site-level programs. Authorizes exemptions from requirements for site-level programs in cases of insignificant environmental degradation or severe economic hardship. Requires State watershed management programs to be approved by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and to achieve full restoration and protection of watersheds within eight years of implementation. Withholds nonpoint source pollution management grants from, and approval of specified discharge permits for, States that fail to comply with watershed management requirements. Requires additional management measures to be taken in watersheds that have not achieved the required goal by the end of the eight-year period. Makes water quality standards enforceable against nonpoint sources of pollution in target watersheds after the expiration of the eight-year period, with exceptions for individuals meeting requirements for an extended compliance period. Extends the authorization of appropriations for nonpoint source pollution management and groundwater quality grants through FY 1998. Title II: Nonpoint Source Prevention on Federal Lands - Requires the President to issue regulations for the prevention and control of nonpoint sources of pollution on Federal lands to provide for full restoration and protection of watersheds within eight years of issuance. Revises existing licenses or operational authorities to comply with regulations. Directs the President to prevent pollution resulting from federally assisted highway construction projects. Prohibits approval of specified highway projects unless they comply with pollution prevention measures promulgated by the President. Title III: Water Quality Criteria; Standards; Antidegradation; New Sources - Directs the Administrator to revise specified water quality criteria triennially and include numerical pollution concentration limits or biological monitoring and assessment methods. Requires States to provide specific numerical criteria for nonpoint source pollutants in water quality standards. Directs the Administrator to issue: (1) antidegradation regulations to apply to nonpoint source pollutants in the same manner that such policies extend to point sources; and (2) guidance for identifying new nonpoint sources. Title IV: Citizen Watershed Monitoring Program - Requires States to establish citizen watershed monitoring programs. Allocates funding for such programs.
