	1/26/1993--Introduced.
Amends rule XV of the Standing Rules of the Senate to set forth the procedure for imposing, after a two-day consideration of a measure, a relevancy requirement on amendments (other than the reported committee amendments). Requires a three-fifths vote, a quorum being present, to: (1) make it out of order to consider an amendment not already agreed to that is not relevant to the measure or the committee amendment; and (2) overturn the Presiding Officer's decision on a question of relevancy or to hold an amendment relevant. Declares that no amendment proposing sense of the Senate (or Congress) language that does not directly relate to the pending matter shall be considered relevant.
