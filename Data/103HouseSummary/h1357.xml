	3/16/1993--Introduced.
Municipal Solid Waste Flow Control Act - Authorizes a State, if conditions under this Act are met, to: (1) direct, limit, regulate, or prohibit the movement of municipal waste generated within its boundaries; and (2) designate waste management facilities to which such waste must be transported. Permits States to exercise such authorities only if: (1) recyclable materials will be removed from the waste through separation at the source or at facilities unless the political subdivision in which the waste is generated is exempt from recycling requirements; and (2) the designated waste management facilities are in compliance with Federal and State environmental laws and regulations. Bars States from prohibiting persons from selling, conveying, or arranging for the transportation of recyclable materials that have been separated from municipal waste. Authorizes States to delegate authorities under this Act to political subdivisions.
