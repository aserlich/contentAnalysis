Makes private U.S. shipyards eligible for program financial assistance or participation. Title II: Guarantees of Obligations for Vessel Construction and United States Shipyard Modernization - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to authorize guarantees of obligations for eligible export vessels (defined as vessels constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned in the United States which will be placed under the laws of another country). Authorizes such guarantees only if the eligible export vessel: (1) will aid in the transition of U.S. shipyards to commercial activities or preserve shipbuilding assets essential in war or a national emergency; and (2) is not transferred to any country hostile to U.S. interests. Authorizes loan guarantees for advanced shipbuilding technology and modern shipbuilding technology of a general U.S. shipyard facility. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Series Construction Assistance - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to pay assistance to a U.S. shipyard owner for the construction of any commercial vessel that is one of a series of vessels for which payment of assistance is approved under this title. Establishes conditions for assistance for series construction, including size and marketability of vessels, shipyard construction capability, applicant ability, and requirements for contracts and purchasers. Title IV: Double Hull Requirement for Tankers Chartered by Department of Defense - Prohibits the Secretary of Defense, after December 31, 1994, from entering into, renewing, or extending a contract for the charter of a tanker unless the tanker: (1) is built in a U.S. shipyard under a contract entered into after October 1, 1993; (2) is equipped with a double hull that satisfies specified tank vessel construction requirements; and (3) is chartered under the contract for at least ten years. Establishes further limitations on the entering into, renewal, or extension of contracts for charters of tankers that expire after December 31, 1994.
