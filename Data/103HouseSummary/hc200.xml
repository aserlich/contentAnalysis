	<summary>
	2/1/1994--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) unduly short State statutes of limitations infringe upon the procedural due process rights of adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse who become aware of the harm of childhood sexual abuse later in life; (2) the States and the District of Columbia should enact comprehensive legislation that affords victims of childhood sexual abuse access to civil courts and should consider legislation allowing criminal prosecution based on the evidence offered by adult survivors; (3) the Attorney General should cooperate with and assist adult survivors and should gather data on State activities in this area and the need for Federal legislation; and (4) the Congress commits itself to revisit the question of the adequacy of State law within two years to protect adult survivors and society's interest in deterring such abuse through the criminal justice system.
