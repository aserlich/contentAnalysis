	7/20/1994--Introduced.
Pennsylvania Avenue Corporation Act of 1994 - Amends the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Act of 1972 to revise congressional findings. Modifies the boundaries of the Pennsylvania Avenue Area. Replaces the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC) with a Government corporation within the executive branch to be known as the Pennsylvania Avenue Corporation. Continues the Pennsylvania Avenue Plan for the area as approved in 1975 and includes estimates of maintenance costs within the plan. Revises corporate powers and duties and authorizes the Corporation to: (1) borrow money from the Treasury in such amounts as may be authorized in appropriations Acts but not to exceed authorized ceilings (currently, not to exceed $120 million); and (2) conduct development competitions using the Development Policies and Procedures established by PADC for private development of property the Corporation owns or may obtain. Removes provisions which require the Corporation to make payments in lieu of real property taxes to the District of Columbia. Transfers all assets, liabilities, and obligations of PADC to the Corporation by October 1, 1997. Imposes criminal penalties for violations of regulations governing the maintenance or use of the Pennsylvania Avenue Area. Makes this Act effective for ten years. Authorizes appropriations.
