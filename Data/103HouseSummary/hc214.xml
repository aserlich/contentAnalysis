	<summary>
	3/3/1994--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should: (1) support existing efforts at national reconciliation in Tajikistan; (2) maintain support for humanitarian assistance to the people of Tajikistan; (3) urge the international community to make similar commitments; (4) seek to obtain full respect by the Tajikistan Government for basic freedoms and internationally recognized human rights; and (5) ensure that a substantial portion of assistance provided to Tajikistan is channeled through nongovernmental organizations and that economic assistance is provided directly to such Government only if specified conditions are met. Includes among such conditions that such Government is making significant progress in protecting and facilitating the activities of human rights groups, participating in and otherwise facilitating conflict resolution efforts and the compilation of a list of all those who have been extrajudicially executed or have disappeared, terminating interference in the nonviolent activities of the political opposition, allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisoners, and facilitating the protection and reintegration of returnees.
